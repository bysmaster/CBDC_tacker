He also outlines how keeping inflation low and stable ensures Canadian money retains its purchasing power.","Good money and your central bank Introduction Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back home in Montréal, especially at this time of year. And it is wonderful to see so many of you again. My final speech of the year is always an opportunity to reflect on the year that was and to look ahead to the year to come. This year, 2025, was marked by the US swerve to protectionism and the resulting upheaval in global trade. It’s a story about uncertainty, and about the loss of trust in our trade relationship with our biggest and best partner. As I look to the year ahead, trust and stability will be critical themes. At its core, the role of the Bank of Canda is to maintain trust in our monetary system. Trust that the bank notes we issue are secure. Trust that our financial system is stable and efficient, so you can be confident that your money is safely stored and easy to use. And trust that the purchasing power of your money will be stable. The other theme for the year ahead is innovation. Stability does not mean standing still. We want to support innovations in money and payments that serve Canadians. That’s why, starting this year, we are overseeing retail payments. And next year, the Bank will add two more responsibilities: regulating stablecoins and implementing consumer-driven banking. With our role as the provider of cash and the supervisor of payments systems, and our mandate to control inflation, these new responsibilities make the Bank a one-stop shop for money you can trust. That’s what I will talk about today—money. Good money. Money that is safe, money that trades at par in all its forms, and money that has stable purchasing power. The Bank must ensure trust and stability of money in all its forms—now, and in the future. We’ve got a lot of ground to cover, so let’s get going. The essence of money So, what is money? Economists typically define money by its functions: a unit of account, a store of value, and a way to trade and transact with trust. 1 Simply put, money is what money does. That’s why I think of money as both the medium—physical bank notes or digital money—and the infrastructure it travels on. Money isn’t much good if you can’t move it around. But when it moves safely and efficiently on trusted infrastructure, money provides vital services to us all. There are two kinds of money: central bank money and private sector money. Central bank money includes bank notes—the cash in your wallet—and settlement balances, which are deposits at the Bank of Canada by members of the payments system. Central bank money is the foundation of the financial system because the central bank stands behind it. Think of a $50 bill. On its own, it’s just a piece of red polymer with an image of an icebreaker in the Arctic. It’s worth $50 only because everyone agrees it’s worth the amount written on it—now and in the future—and everyone trusts that the central bank will back it. Maybe this seems a bit archaic, but my signature is on the money to certify we stand behind every note. Then there’s private sector money. Part of that is banking: the digital money that includes deposits at financial institutions. And part of it is payments: the infrastructure that moves money easily and safely. Private sector money also includes innovations in money, like stablecoins, which I’ll get to in a minute. Central banks play a role in private sector money, too: together with bank regulators and deposit insurance providers, we’re the stewards for the infrastructure that allows money to be stored and moved securely and efficiently. It's critically important to the Bank that Canadian money is good money. That it’s trustworthy and secure. That it can be converted to cash, dollar for dollar, no matter its form. That it trades hands with minimum transaction fees and holds its value with low inflation. Good money ensures an efficient and inclusive financial system. It’s what economists call a “public good”—something everybody can use and benefit from. Without confidence in money, it’s hard to be confident about our economic system. The future of bank notes Now let’s get more concrete, starting with the simplest form of money—cash. Cash has undeniable benefits. It’s simple, widely accepted, inexpensive to use and reliable. It works during power failures and internet outages and is not vulnerable to cyber attack. About 80% of Canadians—perhaps surprisingly, both old and young—and 96% of small- and medium-sized businesses use cash. While the use of cash for daily transactions has declined, cash remains important to many Canadians. It accounts for one in five transactions at the point of sale, and the demand for cash continues to grow with the economy. To be good money, the bank notes we issue have to be easy to authenticate and hard to counterfeit. We issued our first series of notes in 1935, shortly after the Bank was founded. That first series of notes had raised ink and small green dots scattered in the paper, which made the notes hard to counterfeit at the time. But threats have evolved. Our newest bank note will be issued in early 2027. The new vertical $20 will showcase an innovation in anti-counterfeiting security. We’ve used 3-D features before, and we’ve used features that shift when the note is moved. Our $20 note will combine these two technologies for the first time. I wish I could tell you more, but you’ll have to wait for the unveiling next year. What I can tell you is that the new $20 note will feature King Charles III on the front and the Canadian National Vimy Memorial on the back. A new $5 note will follow soon after, picturing Terry Fox. And work has begun to develop larger denominations—the $50 and the $100—to build on the security features of this new series of notes. To be good money, cash also needs to be accessible. And I want to assure you that even as other forms of payment are growing faster than cash, we are committed to ensuring Canadians continue to have access to cash. Developments in digital money Digital money is less tangible than a $50 bill, but it’s everywhere—sitting in bank accounts or moving through payment and settlement systems, across international borders and between your phone and e-commerce websites. There are about three billion Canadian bank notes in circulation, representing about $120 billion in value. By comparison, the money in Canadian chequing accounts is about $1.6 trillion. That digital money has to be good money too—just as secure as bank notes. There are two fronts to protect: banking and payments. On the banking front, Canada has strong regulators—the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and its provincial counterparts—that monitor banks and credit unions to ensure their operations are sound. And money in Canadian bank accounts is insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or its provincial counterparts. The second front is payments—money in motion. Advancements in technology mean Canadians are using digital payments more often. Ideally, you don’t think much about the plumbing of Canada’s payment systems. You tap, and you trust that your money will get from one place to another. The Bank supervises the infrastructure that moves these digital payments. For some 30 years, we’ve overseen Canada’s large-value payments system as well as the clearing and settlement systems critically important to the financial system. About 10 years ago, our oversight was expanded to include other prominent payment systems, including Interac e-Transfer® and the largest credit card networks. This year, the Bank began overseeing retail payments. Since this is a new function, let me explain how it works. When money is moving, it’s facilitated by payment service providers (PSPs). In Canada, there are all kinds of PSPs that help people store or move their money electronically: they offer digital wallets, provide point-of-sale terminals or facilitate cross-border money transfers. The Bank now supervises PSPs to ensure they manage operational risks and safeguard funds held on behalf of Canadian households and businesses, with close to 1,600 PSPs either already registered with the Bank or in the pipeline. This brings PSPs into the regulatory sphere so that Canadians can safely access cheaper payment options and a broader array of services. Now let’s look to the future of digital money and our new responsibilities. Real-Time Rail will speed up payments First, the Bank is working with Payments Canada to modernize Canada’s national payments infrastructure through a project called Real-Time Rail. This will allow payments to clear and settle instantly, 24-7, 365 days a year—making payments here much more efficient. In time it will also allow Canada to link our system to those in other countries so that money can move across borders more quickly. Real-Time Rail will also give PSPs direct access to the payments system, increasing competition and adding efficiency. Stablecoins may bring payment innovation Next is the frontier of digital money: stablecoins—a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to be money. The biggest cryptocurrency by value is Bitcoin. Bitcoin has some features of money—it did create a new unit of account—but it’s not really money. Its price is very volatile, making it a lousy store of value, and it’s difficult to use in everyday transactions. It’s more of an investment, albeit a speculative one. Stablecoins are different. They’re designed with the intention to always be convertible to a currency at par. So they overcome the price volatility of other cryptocurrencies while taking advantage of the same technology. The biggest stablecoins in circulation right now are Tether and Circle’s USDC, both pegged to the US dollar. Other stablecoins have been issued in euros, and there are proposals for stablecoins pegged to the Canadian dollar. The stability of stablecoins means they hold more promise as a form of payment, although it’s hard to know how much of a role they’ll play in the future of money. The US GENIUS Act created a legislative framework for stablecoins and opened the door to their broader use in global payments. And the industry is keen to deliver. Other countries are also looking at how to bring the benefits of stablecoins to businesses and consumers while minimizing the risks of fraud or instability. It is important for Canada to have its own regulatory framework for stablecoins. In the federal budget last month, the government announced it will do just that, with the Bank of Canada as the regulator. The draft legislation lays out the core elements of the framework. The proposed Stablecoins Act will regulate stablecoin issuers, and the retail payments legislation will be amended so that it also applies to stablecoin payments. The goal is to ensure Canadians can leverage the innovation of stablecoins and do so safely. We want stablecoins to be good money, like bank notes or money on deposit at banks. That requires a few critical elements. A stablecoin must be pegged at a one-to-one ratio to a central bank currency and be backed by high-quality liquid assets so that it can always be converted to cash at par. The conditions for redeeming stablecoins must be fully disclosed, including the timing and any fees that need to be paid. Stablecoins made available for purchase by individuals and businesses in Canada should be assured of these protections. And issuers of stablecoins must have enough operational resilience to make stablecoins reliable. We will work closely with the Department of Finance Canada to support the drafting of regulations next year so Canadians can use stablecoins with confidence. Open banking gives Canadians more control The Bank’s other new responsibility is part of the push for consumer-driven banking, also known as open banking. For money to work for Canadians, Canadians must be confident the banking system is working for them. Open banking will give you more control over your financial data, so you can do more with your money. It will make it easier to compare banks and switch providers or share data with third parties such as budgeting apps, investment tools or credit applications. It will make the system more efficient and more competitive, and it should drive innovation. As with Real-Time Rail and stablecoins, we need to ensure supervision of participants and high standards for technology in open banking to safeguard customer data and minimize the risk of fraud. Open banking is a bit different from our other responsibilities, but the overlap with the other parts of our supervisory mandate is clear: the Bank has experience keeping money and payments secure so you can use your money safely and easily. Open banking extends this to storing and moving financial information safely and easily. The regimes for stablecoins and open banking must be built thoughtfully. The technology is evolving rapidly, and the regulatory framework will need to evolve to keep pace with the changing landscape. It is important that Canadians can benefit from new technology and new services—safely and securely. Preserving the value of money That brings me to the final component of good money: it needs to hold its value. All the forms of money I’ve mentioned, from bank notes to stablecoins, must have stable purchasing power. In Canada, as in most other major countries, we have defined that as 2% inflation. When inflation is around 2%, the value of our money is relatively stable and the economy works well. We don’t have to go back far in time to remember how painful it can be if we don’t preserve the value of our money. Canada’s economy overheated in 2022 when the post-pandemic surge in demand ran up against still-impaired supply chains. Combined with Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, this pushed inflation just above 8%. The cost of both goods and services rose too fast. The money people had was buying fewer goods and services. People felt ripped off. When inflation gets out of control, we lose price stability—and we risk losing trust. If elevated inflation persists, it becomes entrenched in people’s expectations, making it more difficult to bring inflation back to target. That’s why we responded forcefully, raising interest rates at a historically rapid pace. It worked. Longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, and we were able to restore 2% inflation without a recession. But high inflation has had a lasting impact. Inflation has been back around 2% for more than a year, but price levels are a lot higher than they were before the pandemic. That’s why it’s so important that inflation stay low and stable, so incomes can catch up. The pandemic experience reminds us that trust cannot be taken for granted—it has to be earned and maintained. In Canada, we review and renew our monetary policy framework with the federal government every five years. It’s one way we preserve Canadians’ trust. With the renewal coming up in 2026, we’re taking a fresh look at whether our inflation-targeting framework is still fit for purpose. As we review, we recognize that structural shifts—the rise of artificial intelligence, climate change, trade disruptions and geopolitical instability—make global economies increasingly vulnerable to shocks and uncertainty. We want to be sure the way we use our flexible inflation-targeting framework gives us the best chance of keeping inflation low and stable in a more shock-prone world. We want to provide the best information to Canadians about how we’re doing that. And we want to better understand the link between inflation and housing affordability. One thing we’re not reviewing is whether 2% inflation is the best target. We’re confident it is. Flexible inflation targeting has proven to be more successful and more durable than anything that came before. In the 25 years leading up to the pandemic, inflation in Canada averaged very close to the 2% target and was inside the 1% to 3% band about 80% of the time. And yes, the pandemic tested our framework like never before, but as difficult as that was, the framework guided our actions to restore low inflation. Faced with a more shock-prone world, the anchor provided by the 2% target looks more important than ever. But we need to look at how we conduct monetary policy to hit the 2% target. The economic landscape is shifting. Protectionist US trade policy and high tariffs are adding costs and creating economic volatility. More generally, ongoing structural changes are turning into headwinds that have the potential to disrupt supply and add inflationary pressures. The renewal of our monetary policy framework in 2026 is the opportunity to ensure we are ready for a more shock-prone world. Good money in all its forms is only as good as its purchasing power. Conclusion It’s time for me to wrap up. This has been a pivotal year for the global economy. The reconfiguration of global trade and the restructuring of Canada’s economy will likely continue to dominate the economic landscape in 2026. Last week, Governing Council maintained the Bank’s policy interest rate at 2¼%. US tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and lumber have hit these sectors hard, and uncertainty is weighing on business investment. But so far, the economy is proving resilient overall. Inflationary pressures continue to be contained despite added costs related to the reconfiguration of trade. Total CPI inflation has been close to the 2% target for more than a year now, and we expect it to remain near the target. In the current situation, Governing Council sees the policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. Uncertainty is of course still very high. If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. At the Bank of Canada, we are focused on managing the present and preparing for the future. We will support the economy through this period of transition while keeping inflation well controlled. And we will safeguard the essential features of good money—security, convertibility and price stability—while ensuring Canadians can benefit from innovations in money and financial services. We can and must be both a source of stability and an engine of progress. As money changes with innovation and our economy faces new challenges, the Bank of Canada will be there for Canadians. You can count on us to maintain the trust and stability of your money. Thank you.

We simulate payment scenarios with liquidity shocks and competing priorities to test the agent’s ability to maintain precautionary liquidity buffers, dynamically prioritize payments under tight constraints, and optimize the trade-off between settlement speed and liquidity usage. Our results show that even without domain-specific training, the AI agent closely replicates key prudential cash-management practices, issuing calibrated recommendations that preserve liquidity while minimizing delays. These findings suggest that routine cash-management tasks could be automated using general-purpose large language models, potentially reducing operational costs and improving intraday liquidity efficiency.

He also highlights the Bank’s new role as supervisor of payment service providers.","Making change—Accelerating payments innovation Introduction Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak before this year’s Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) conference. When I accepted this invitation, no one told me I would be speaking on the same day—and following—two Olympic gold medallists! I don’t like to brag, but I did receive a participation award in middle school for finishing dead last at the annual track and field meet. Hold your applause, please. Fortunately, I’ve found my calling outside the world of sport, and I’ll do my level best to live up to Tessa and Alexandre’s inspiring words. As we all know, the world around us is changing—and quickly. Geopolitical tensions are simmering and, in some cases, boiling over. We are seeing seismic shifts in trading relationships and a great deal of uncertainty in the global economy. At the same time, one of the cornerstones of economies everywhere—how individuals and businesses pay for goods and services—is also facing big changes. Unfortunately, Canada lags other jurisdictions when it comes to payments innovation. We’re behind in adopting new technology, fostering new entrants and providing Canadians with faster and cheaper payment options. Recently, we’ve seen positive momentum and significant engagement from both the public and private sectors on these issues. But we have much more work to do and many more opportunities to harness. We can—and we must—build on this momentum to foster greater innovation and create a more competitive payments ecosystem. There’s a saying that goes something like this, “Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you sit there.” So it’s time we get up off the track, and get moving. Innovation is everywhere Today, two main forces are leading innovation in the payments ecosystem: new technology and new players. In the late 1960s, the Chargex card was big news. As the first credit card in Canada, it offered an alternative to cash and cheques. Today, technology allows us to pay for items instantaneously with a tap—and tapping our credit or debit card represents about half of all transactions at the point of sale. 1 The vast majority of Canadians also have a smartphone, and many of those smartphones support digital payments. 2 We’ve seen these mobile payments become more popular recently. The Bank of Canada’s most recent Methods-of-Payment Survey revealed that about 5% of payment transactions are made with a smartphone. This is a small number, but it’s growing quickly, and it almost doubled between 2023 and 2024. 3 Perhaps the most innovative advancement in recent years is the emergence of autonomous artificial intelligence, known as agentic AI. Unlike traditional AI that responds to human commands—like “Alexa, please call Pam, my Chartered Professional Accountant”—agentic AI is trained to know your preferences and can act without much human direction. Imagine a world where you give your AI agent a budget to not only curate your next vacation but also book it and pay for it—all without you lifting a finger. The payments space is benefiting from several new types of players. Take digital-only financial institutions, for example. These institutions offer the same services as traditional banks through online platforms and mobile apps—but with no physical locations. New fintech companies are rolling out the smartphone applications I just spoke of. And both foreign and domestic money transfer companies are broadening their services. A few investment dealers have also entered the fray with a new range of payments services. A closer look at cryptocurrencies Now, we can’t talk about payments innovation without paying close attention to the rise of cryptocurrencies. These can be used to facilitate transactions, independent of central banks and governments. At this point, while it’s possible to use cryptocurrencies to pay for things, very few people do. For example, survey data from the Bank suggest that only 10% of Canadians hold bitcoin. Among those who do, they hold, on average, about $500 worth of it. Moreover, most of those who hold bitcoin do so for investment purposes. Only about 10% of the small number who hold bitcoin would consider using it to make payments. 4 This could be because price volatility is one of the key drawbacks of using bitcoin for payments. Prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fluctuate based on supply and demand. This leads to large swings that make cryptocurrencies a very risky method of payment. To make a stark analogy, paying with bitcoin is like agreeing to pay for your lunch with shares of a tech start-up. By the time the restaurant cashes them in, the price of your sandwich could have doubled—or halved. It’s a bit of a different story with stablecoins. These are a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, and generally trade close to the value of that currency. They are designed to overcome the price volatility that comes with using other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for making payments. More recently, there is growing interest in using stablecoins for cross-border payments to make transactions faster and cheaper. Globally, stablecoin use has been rising in recent years and now accounts for around US$1 trillion in annual transactions. 5 That’s about US$2.7 billion per day. This is a significant amount, however to put it in context, last year Canada’s high-value payment system (Lynx) processed Can$386 billion every day. 6 Nevertheless, stablecoin use is growing, driven by the high cost and low speed of traditional cross-border payment services, which pose challenges to citizens and economies around the world. This is particularly true in emerging economies where families may rely on money transfers from a loved one working abroad. Let me give you a practical Canadian example. For many who immigrated here from overseas and want to send money home, the cost of international money transfers is significantly higher in Canada than in jurisdictions like the United States and United Kingdom. 7 There is a pressing need for faster, cheaper, more transparent and more accessible cross-border payments services. But these services also need to be safe and secure. With any innovation there are also opportunities for more nefarious applications—like criminal activity. The 2025 Annual Economic Report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) sounded the alarm on this issue. 8 The BIS report suggests bringing legitimate stablecoin functions into the existing regulated monetary system. Regulation can ensure that stablecoins are, indeed, stable—and don’t pose risks to the financial system. At the end of the day, for stablecoins to be seen as money, they need to be as safe and stable as the balance in your bank account. On regulation And certainly, regulation can help address concerns and challenges associated with this technology. Governments are moving to regulate stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies so consumers can reap their benefits and be protected from credit and liquidity risks. In fact, many jurisdictions worldwide either have, or will soon have, a regulatory framework for cryptoassets. 9 Here in Canada, government regulation of digital assets is mostly carried out through provincial securities and derivatives regulation. At the federal level, anti-money laundering legislation has provisions that allow the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada to regulate virtual currency exchange or transfer services. Canada should also weigh the merits of federal stablecoin regulation, similar to what other countries have done. The private sector is also beginning to usher stablecoins into mainstream use. Three months ago, Shopify announced that stablecoins are now a standard option for payments. And just last week, Tetra Digital Group, alongside a number of fintech and financial market partners, announced its intention to launch a Canadian fiat-backed stablecoin in 2026. All of this to say, there’s scope for a lot of potential change, but there’s also the need for some caution. Let me be clear—that doesn’t mean moving slowly. But keeping up with innovation and putting appropriate guardrails in place requires a delicate balance. Squaring the concepts of speed and safety isn’t a new preoccupation. I recently came across a speech that former Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen delivered in March 1999. One passage from 26 years ago struck me because it remains relevant today. “To find a balance between the twin objectives of efficiency and safety has always been a challenge for governments when they examine proposals to change the regulatory framework for the financial system.” There are ways to harness the innovations happening around us to bring greater benefits to Canadian consumers in the form of lower costs, greater efficiency, more convenience, faster speed and better quality. Safe and reliable payments systems support the efficiency of every economy. Payment infrastructures support the whole financial system and facilitate all financial market transactions. They are a pillar of trust and efficiency supporting economic and financial well-being. This is why federal and provincial regulators must work quickly and collaboratively to evolve our regulatory frameworks—“while balancing the twin objectives of efficiency and safety.” This is key to ensuring Canadians can safely reap the benefits of innovation. Canada is working to support innovation I don’t want to leave you with the impression that innovation in Canada’s payments infrastructure is non-existent. We’ve adopted global standards to support data-rich payments and we are implementing a new, fast payments system. The long-awaited Real-Time Rail (RTR) is expected to begin industry testing soon. Furthermore, the passage of the Consumer-Driven Banking Act in 2024 was an important milestone for supporting competition—although further legislative changes are required to bring this regime to life. And key industry groups are calling for consumer-driven banking to be elevated to a national priority. 10 To date, however, the pace of change here in Canada has been—to use a kind word—gradual. Other major jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, Australia and the European Union have already embraced changes in many areas. Results from a recent survey of Canadian business leaders showed that almost 60% of respondents said that Canada’s competitiveness will continue to decline without further payments modernization. Even more called for our financial and payments systems to be modernized immediately to allow for open banking, digital identity and real-time payments. 11 Clearly, there is a need to accelerate change within our own borders. As we do this, we must build on the stability and trust Canadians have come to expect from their institutions. Fortunately, we’re starting with one advantage: many people don’t worry about what happens behind the scenes when they tap their debit or credit cards. Safeguarding that trust and confidence will be of the utmost importance as we collectively venture into new territories in the payments ecosystem. How the Bank fits in The Bank has an important role to play alongside other agencies and regulators. We work with these organizations to ensure Canadians can continue to count on a stable financial system, and benefit from important evolutions in the payments landscape. Our role is threefold. We oversee financial market infrastructures and payment service providers, which I’ll come back to in a moment. We also monitor financial stability to identify systemic risks that could affect the functioning of the financial system. And we design and produce bank notes that Canadians can use with confidence. This is important because—even with new and innovative payment methods—cash is still used in one out of every five transactions at the point of sale. 12 On an international scale, the Bank is collaborating with the BIS by sponsoring one of seven Innovation Hubs. The Toronto Hub opened in June 2024—the first centre in the Americas. Its focus is to help develop technology that central banks can use for the public good in Canada and throughout the region. For example, the Bank is engaging with the Hub to start thinking about how AI can support our work as a supervisor and a regulator. This will involve learning from other jurisdictions that are using AI to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their supervisory activities. Another area we are exploring is how Canada can harness the benefits of tokenization—the process of recording digital assets on blockchains so these assets can be exchanged more efficiently. These efforts support work the Bank is already doing to engage with industry members and find projects we can work on together—with the end goal of delivering better outcomes for Canadians. A new role for the Bank Now, I want to take a moment to talk about our newest mandate: supervising payment service providers, or PSPs. Every day, millions of Canadians make payments with the expectation that their money will move safely, reliably and without interruption. Under the Retail Payment Activities Act , the Bank now supervises close to 1,500 PSPs to ensure they manage risks and safeguard funds held on behalf of Canadian households and businesses. The Act provides a solid framework for protecting consumers’ funds. It brings PSPs into the regulatory sphere so that Canadians can access cheaper payment options and a broader array of services. Moreover, PSPs overseen by the Bank can gain access to Canada’s national payments infrastructure, which opens the door to further competition and innovation. It’s a real-life example of the kind of change we need. It lays the foundation for payments systems that can adapt to new technologies, withstand shocks and help drive our economy forward. The Bank will begin to publish the Registry of PSPs, and update it on a rolling basis, as the national security screenings are finalized and names are provided to the Bank by the Department of Finance. 13 , 14 However, I want to stress that all PSPs are now expected to comply with their regulatory obligations. And once registered, they will need to meet additional reporting requirements. Everyone here has an important role to play in supporting PSPs through this transition. Some of you may have already spoken with clients who are looking for advice on how to comply with our supervisory expectations or want help navigating this new reality. Conclusion It’s time for me to wrap up. I hope my speech today has opened your eyes to some great changes to the payments system happening at home and around the world. But there is much more to do. We should seize opportunities to make the system more efficient and more productive—like opening up settlement and payment rails and continuing work on open banking. To do so, we must think big—and then think even bigger. Let’s consider how Canada’s industry and regulators can work together to develop forward-thinking, proactive polices that will benefit all Canadians. And let’s consider how we best balance efficiency and safety. Because innovation cannot come at the cost of personal or national security. The good news is we have a system that Canadians trust. Now is the time to build on this solid foundation, to be ambitious and to push for an exciting future in the payments ecosystem. For our part, the Bank will certainly not sit idly on the rails. So let’s get on board the innovation train, imagine the possibilities of where we can go together—and go full steam ahead. I would like to thank Melanie Achtemichuk and Francisco Rivadeneyra for their help in preparing this speech.",html,2026-01-07 09:31:45,,,,,

Innovations in how we pay From Canada’s first credit card in the 1960s to tap-and-pay technology and mobile wallets, paying for goods and services has changed a lot over the years. The pace of change is now accelerating. And many new players are offering innovative ways to make payments. One big development is the rise of cryptocurrencies. Even though people can use cryptocurrencies to pay for things, very few do. Most who own them simply hold them as an investment. This may be because the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are very volatile, making them a risky method of payment. Stablecoins are a less volatile type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar. And their use as a method of payment is rising, particularly in cross-border transactions. Making cross-border payments through traditional services can be slow and expensive. Stablecoins are proving to be a cheaper and faster alternative. But there are risks. Consumers have limited protections if something goes wrong because stablecoins are not yet regulated. There is also the risk of criminal activity. One solution is to bring stablecoins into the existing financial system. This would protect consumers, businesses and the broader financial system. At the end of the day, for stablecoins to be seen as money, they need to be as safe and stable as the balance in your bank account.” At the end of the day, for stablecoins to be seen as money, they need to be as safe and stable as the balance in your bank account.” Canada needs to pick up the pace The future of payments ecosystems is exciting, and it is great to see so many new and innovative products and services. And while we don’t want to slow the pace of this innovation, we do need appropriate guardrails. Industry experts and regulators need to work together—and quickly—to develop policies and a regulatory framework to protect Canadians. Canada also needs to speed up progress on modernizing the payments system infrastructure. The Bank’s official capacity in this area is limited. But Bank staff are researching and testing new payments technologies. And the Bank is working with domestic and international partners on projects using artificial intelligence and blockchain technology that could benefit our payments ecosystem. We should seize opportunities to make the system more efficient and more productive—like opening up settlement and payment rails and continuing work on open banking. To do so, we must think big—and then think even bigger.” We should seize opportunities to make the system more efficient and more productive—like opening up settlement and payment rails and continuing work on open banking.

New technologies are creating new payment possibilities—and potential risks You’re thumbing your way through your social media feed when you see an outfit that jumps off the screen. You select your size, click buy and just like that, your new threads are on the way. Easy-peasy. This seamless experience is made possible by embedded finance, and it’s just one of the ways that technology is changing how people buy things. These days, you can buy a coffee, split a restaurant tab with your friends, or send money to your relatives on the other side of the world—all with just a few clicks on a cell phone. Financial technology—or fintech for short—can have many benefits. It can make financial services cheaper, more convenient and easier to access. An app or a website is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So, you can use financial services when you need them. And without the need to maintain a storefront, many fintech firms have lower operating costs than traditional financial institutions. So, they can choose to charge lower fees for their services. Thousands of fintech companies already provide financial services in Canada, and there's still room to grow. In many other countries, fintech is even more widely used. New technologies, new risks Financial innovation is nothing new. People have been finding new ways to pay for things for centuries. Paper money was first used about a thousand years ago, and cheques have been around for centuries. Credit cards came onto the scene in the early 1950s, and the first contactless payment system launched in Seoul, South Korea in 1995. Each of these innovations has made making purchases easier, encouraging economic activity. When transactions can happen more quickly and more easily, businesses can make more sales, and more money circulates through the economy. But the rise of fintech has also introduced new risks. Fintech apps and websites that provide financial services often rely on multiple software providers to give you a more personalized experience. With more players involved in every transaction, there is a higher risk of data breaches and fraud. And so far, most fintech companies have not been as strictly regulated in Canada as banks or credit unions. But for payment service providers, Canada has implemented a federal law that requires them to register with the Bank of Canada. Our job is to supervise these payment service providers on behalf of all Canadians, so you can be confident in the payment systems you use. Not cashing out—bank notes are still an essential part of the economy Despite the rapid rise of fintech, cash is not going anywhere. Every single day, millions of payments are made using bank notes in Canada. And that will continue because cash still has many advantages over other forms of payment. Cash is the most private way to make a transaction and does not require any information to be exchanged. It is accepted by most stores, and it can be used by anyone—no smartphone or credit card required. About one million people in Canada don’t have a bank account, and for them, cash purchases are essential. The way Canadians pay for things is changing, and the Bank is playing an important role in ensuring the safety and security of Canada’s bank notes and payment systems. So, whether you’re withdrawing some cash from the ATM or enjoying the benefits of new payment technologies, you can pay with confidence. We want to hear from you Comment or suggestion?

I’m sure many of you share my sentiments about these virtual events—that we would much rather be together in person, and yet we are grateful for the technology that allows us to gather online. The need to switch to this digital platform is, of course, just one small example of the changes brought on by the global pandemic. COVID-19 has claimed the lives of far too many—in Canada, we have lost more than 20,000 people. The virus has had a devastating impact on households and businesses across the country. Almost overnight, the Canadian economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. One major impact of the pandemic is certainly familiar to all of us by now: the digitalization of our personal and professional lives has accelerated. In my remarks today, I’ll focus on how these developments have affected the world of payments. I’m referring to changes in the way Canadian consumers and businesses pay for goods, services and financial assets. I’ll begin by talking briefly about the economic consequences of the pandemic. Then I’ll go on to discuss the implications for three main aspects of payments. The first is the concept of a central bank digital currency—a “digital loonie,” as it were. For several years, the Bank of Canada has been analyzing which circumstances might lead Canada to decide to issue a digital currency. The pandemic may bring us to a decision point sooner than we had anticipated. Next, I’d like to look at a major program of payment system modernization underway in Canada. Consumers and businesses will see the benefits of this modernization rolling out this year and next. The pandemic has underscored the importance of expanding the reach of real-time payments. Finally, I will address the issue of cross-border payments, which are often slow, expensive and vulnerable to fraud. The Bank has collaborated with international partners on a roadmap to address the pain points in cross-border payments. We are fully committed to working with the public and private sectors to make any necessary changes in Canada to support this. COVID-19 and the digital economy The digitalization of the economy was well underway before COVID-19 hit, but the changes brought on by the pandemic have been rapid and far-reaching. As a society, we had to quickly implement the virtual workplaces we had largely only been imagining. Nearly one-third of Canadians are mostly working from home, 1 including me—I have been in my office only eight times since last March. In addition, many students continue to learn virtually. COVID-19 has also changed how we shop. A survey of Canadian retailers shows that e-commerce has nearly doubled from pre-pandemic levels. 2 Businesses are responding to the pandemic by incorporating new technologies into their operations. In our most recent Business Outlook Survey, nearly two-thirds of participating firms reported that they are making some kind of digital investment. 3 Expanding their business online was commonly cited as the reason for these investments—on both the operations and client-facing sides. Among these developments is a shift toward the increasing use of digital payments. For example, a November 2020 survey found that two-thirds of small businesses now accept payments online—and half of them started doing so only recently. 4 Even when Canadians pay for goods in person, contactless options appear to be gaining traction. Interac reports that the volume of Interac Flash transactions grew by two-thirds in July 2020 compared with April. 5 Consumer surveys also report that contactless payments have increased. 6 The Bank of Canada has been carefully watching these trends. We are particularly interested in how the pandemic has changed the way that Canadians purchase goods and services. And we are keenly aware of the need to seize the opportunities that lie before us to give Canadians even better, cheaper and faster payment methods. Cash: physical and digital Let’s start with Canadian bank notes. As we have all embraced technology and its many innovations, one thing that hasn’t changed as much is cash. It’s true that the Bank has updated bank notes in new and exciting ways. We’ve incorporated state-of-the-art security features to combat counterfeiting. We now make bank notes using polymer instead of paper. And we’ve made a concerted effort to ensure the images and portrait subjects on bank notes reflect Canada’s unique and changing identity. But the basic nature of bank notes has not changed—they are still physical objects. However, for the past decade or so, the Bank has been considering these bank notes, and we’ve been asking ourselves: could Canada and Canadians benefit from a digital form of cash? In a speech in Montréal a year ago, I gave our preliminary view: we did not see a need for a central bank digital currency at that time, but we could imagine scenarios that could make a central bank digital currency beneficial in Canada. I concluded that we would move forward to develop such a digital currency as a contingency plan, given how quickly the world is changing and the time required to develop a viable product. 7 A year later, our view remains unchanged: a digital currency is by no means a foregone conclusion. That said, the world has been changing even faster than we expected. In fact, just two weeks after I spoke, the first lockdown was imposed, which accelerated the evolution of the digital economy. And so our work to prepare for the day when Canada might want to launch a digital loonie—backed by the Bank—has also accelerated. We are not alone. In a recent survey, almost 60 percent of central banks reported the possibility that they will issue a central bank digital currency within six years. This is up from less than 40 percent only a year ago. 8 One scenario we have been watching is whether a sharp decline in the acceptance of cash reaches a tipping point in Canada. We’ve already seen that as societies and economies modernize, cash has been losing ground to digital methods of payment—around the world and here at home. 9 Since COVID-19 hit, we’ve seen a growing hesitancy in Canada to use cash. Although Canadians are holding more cash than ever, cash may not currently be circulating as much. In recent Bank of Canada surveys, consumers report some merchant preference for contactless payments, and some report experiencing merchants’ refusal of cash due to fears of virus transmission. 6 Of course, it’s too early to tell whether these trends will continue beyond the pandemic, but we are watching closely. The other scenario I raised in my speech last year is the increasing use of digital currencies created by the private sector, including cryptocurrencies and so-called stablecoins. While these products have existed for several years, some could see a boost from the acceleration of digitalization in the midst of the pandemic. Even in this increasingly digital economy, though, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin do not have a plausible claim to become the money of the future. They are deeply flawed as methods of payment—except for illicit transactions like money laundering, where anonymity trumps all other features—because they rely on costly verification methods and their purchasing power is wildly unstable. The recent spike in their prices looks less like a trend and more like a speculative mania—an atmosphere in which one high-profile tweet is enough to trigger a sudden jump in price. In contrast, widespread adoption of stablecoins for everyday transactions is possible, although none is near that point yet. Because in most cases they are partly or fully backed by safe assets, their purchasing power is designed to be more stable. But many issues need to be addressed before we can be confident that stablecoins can be used safely by the general public. The Financial Stability Board is examining these issues at the global level, and I am chairing the international working group that is taking this work forward. Here in Canada, we still have work to do to ensure that our regulatory framework covers these new products. Amid all of these developments, two fundamental questions need to be addressed: Are there benefits to issuing a digital form of money? And if yes, who should do so? In response to the first question, we don’t yet know whether many Canadians will actually want to use a stablecoin or any other kind of digital currency when they have alternatives available—cash, debit, credit and electronic transfer. Would the addition of a digital form of cash to the existing suite of digital payment methods meet a real demand and enhance the evolution of a competitive, vibrant digital economy? More work is clearly needed to identify the potential benefits to users, compared with other alternatives. And of course we also need to study potential risks. In response to the second question, if the public does want a digital cash-like currency, some good reasons illustrate why a central bank—a trusted public institution—should issue it. Currency is a core part of the Bank’s mandate, and the integrity of our currency is a public good that all Canadians benefit from. Only a central bank can guarantee complete safety and universal access, and with public interest—not profits—as the top priority. Let me spell out one aspect. It has been said that in the digital economy, data is the new oil. Many technology companies follow a business model in which they use their customers’ data to refine and expand the range of products and services they offer to the public. This, in turn, pulls more and more business onto their platform, which generates more data, and so on. If that business model were used as a foundation for the dominant method of payment in the economy, the issuer would gain control over an enormous range of data—bringing with it overwhelming market power. 10 In effect, a technology company could become the gatekeeper of the entire economy, with concerning implications for privacy, competition and inclusion. Let’s compare this with a central bank digital currency. A central bank—with no commercial motivation to harvest data—is uniquely positioned to build in safeguards for privacy, while at the same time defending against criminal uses. Privacy is clearly important to Canadians, and it’s also in the public interest to protect some degree of privacy. 11 Universal access would need to be another key feature of a central bank digital currency. That means ensuring that remote and marginalized communities—including but not limited to the underbanked and unbanked—are not left out of this new way to pay for goods and services. As part of our advancing work, the Bank has been researching and experimenting with different technologies. In addition, we recently engaged three university project teams to independently develop proposals for what a digital currency ecosystem could look like. Their reports will be released tomorrow. This blue-sky thinking will help inform our research going forward. We are also carefully considering what the business model for a Canadian central bank digital currency might look like: What role would the private sector play in its development, distribution and transfer? How would this product interface with Canada’s core payments systems that transfer funds among financial institutions to settle both retail and large-scale payments? Modernizing our core payments systems Long before the pandemic hit, efforts to modernize Canada’s core payments systems had already begun. This work is important, and with the rapid expansion of the digital economy accelerated by the pandemic, we can now see the benefits more clearly. Led by Payments Canada, several key players in the payments ecosystem—such as Interac, commercial banks and other stakeholders—have been working to bring these payments systems fully into the modern digital age. The Bank of Canada is heavily involved as a central bank, a regulator and, in some cases, a participant. Over the next year or so, these improvements will start to come online. This is important for Canadians because it will mean greater speed, convenience, competition and choice in how people pay for goods and services. Right now, the fastest and most immediate money transfers we see are e-Transfers. But the new Real-Time Rail system—which will go live in 2022—will provide real-time payments beyond what is already offered through e-Transfer. When this innovation is complete, we can imagine scenarios like these: businesses being able to pay part-time workers immediately upon completion of their shift; homebuyers putting down the deposit on their first home with a click of a button instead of physically taking a bank draft to their lawyer’s office; and governments being able to distribute emergency funds in a matter of seconds, directly into citizens’ bank accounts. The Bank is also helping to improve other core payments systems. This includes an interbank payment system called Lynx, which will replace the current Large Value Transfer System this autumn. Lynx’s up-to-date technology includes enhanced safeguards against cyber and other risks. Another system we’re looking to improve is the one that clears cheques and other low-value payments. Improvements here will further expand consumers’ choices for convenient digital payments. Two other important developments, which I will briefly describe, will complement these changes. The first is retail payments supervision. This past August, the Bank assumed oversight responsibility for the Interac e-Transfer system under our current mandate. And the Government of Canada has announced its intention to give the Bank of Canada further oversight authority for retail payment service providers—companies that aren’t traditional banks but specialize in processing payments for the public. By ensuring that risks are well managed, the Bank, through its new supervisory role, will support confidence in payment service providers and should further encourage competition and innovation in retail payments. The second development is open banking, which will remove the barriers for banking customers to safely and easily share their financial information if they choose to engage other service providers in managing their money and other assets. Open banking will help promote greater competition and choice by allowing consumers and businesses to more easily compare the products and services various financial institutions offer. Several countries have already introduced open banking, and the federal government has launched consultations on how to implement it in Canada. This is being done to ensure that innovations are balanced with data control and privacy considerations. We have come a long way, but more work remains. And this work takes on greater urgency as we find ourselves in an environment where the current system’s shortcomings could limit the ability of consumers and businesses to pursue the opportunities created by the digital economy. Thankfully, Canadians can look forward to significant improvements in the speed, convenience, efficiency and choice of digital payments in the near future. This is an important part of the Bank’s responsibility to promote safe, sound and efficient financial systems. Cross-border payments I’d like to turn now to the issue of cross-border payments, an area that has an obvious and pressing need for improvement. Sending money abroad has always been notoriously slow and expensive for individuals and businesses—so much so that it interferes with lives and livelihoods. Issues with cross-border payments affect millions of Canadians. This includes new Canadians who send money to family in their country of origin. It includes snowbirds who split their time between Canada and warmer climates—although not this winter, for the most part. And it includes many Canadian businesses that face unnecessary costs and delays in paying for supplies and services from abroad or in receiving payment for the things they sell outside the country. Beyond our borders, the issues are even more pressing for developing countries, where many individuals rely on family members abroad to send them money so they can afford basic necessities such as food, clothing and education. Many of these needs have become more acute with the uneven global impact of the pandemic. Put simply, the problems with sending money across borders create disadvantages that can prevent already impoverished people and countries from fully participating in the global economy. In fact, these issues have been used as an argument for the creation and use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. But there is plenty of room to improve cross-border payments without using these novel methods of payment, which would not by themselves fix the problems with cross-border payments. As part of an initiative endorsed by the G20 and coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, the Bank of Canada and other central banks and regulators have developed a roadmap to solve some of these problems. Our main goal is to support faster and cheaper cross-border payments that are more accessible and transparent. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech today, we have identified numerous pain points in cross-border payments. Technological shortcomings certainly pose problems with different messaging standards in different countries. Anti-terrorism and anti–money laundering regulations—while crucial for our safety and security—can also slow the transfer of money, with multiple compliance checks. And of course, there are numerous time zones to consider. When you send money from Ottawa at noon all the way to Cambodia, the local payment system there isn’t open at midnight to process the funds. The G20 roadmap is extensive and lays out work that several different organizations will carry out. For our part, the Bank is working with partners internationally—most notably the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures at the Bank for International Settlements. But just as important, we’re also putting the pieces in place in Canada to support the coordinated domestic effort that will be necessary to identify and address the most pressing issues from a Canadian perspective. For all of these efforts to be successful, central banks and other authorities around the world who are working on this will need the cooperation of public and private sector partners in their own jurisdictions. Only then can we make lasting improvements to cross-border payments and ensure that people, businesses and nations around the world have the best opportunity to truly participate in the global economy. Conclusion Canadians may take our current payments ecosystem for granted because buying goods and services is already relatively simple. Long gone are the days when making a large impulse buy on a weekend was next to impossible, because your bank wasn’t open for you to withdraw cash. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to provide Canadians with greater choice in how they pay for goods and services. Digital payment methods are integral to a truly digital economy, and can open up endless possibilities for further digital innovation. And as we all struggle with the personal, professional and economic ramifications of the pandemic, it’s even more important that the Bank move forward with this work. The Bank will continue to explore the possibilities of a digital currency that would be an electronic version of the bank notes that Canadians trust and rely on. We will issue such a currency only if and when the time is right, with the support of Canadians and the federal government, and with the best evidence in hand. We can and will make our core payments systems more effective and efficient to help consumers and businesses exchange funds in real time. And we will push forward with work to make cross-border payments cheaper, easier and safer for people around the globe to send and receive money.

Thank you very much for inviting me here today to share some thoughts on how technological innovations are transforming the world of money and payments. Technology has certainly changed every aspect of life. People now work, shop and stay in touch with each other very differently than even 10 years ago. Technology is also changing the way Canadians pay for things. Digital payments in the form of debit, credit and prepaid cards are commonplace. We are also seeing mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as the ability to send money by email. There is even limited use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The Bank of Canada is looking carefully at how money and payments are evolving. This is because one of our key public policy objectives is to help ensure Canadians can use their preferred methods of payment with confidence. New technologies in our payment systems mean new opportunities and benefits for consumers, businesses and financial institutions. But they also raise the potential for new risks to our financial system. In my remarks today, I want to talk about how the Bank of Canada is responding to this evolving environment. And part of our response involves looking at whether a case could—or should—be made in the future for a digital currency issued by the Bank of Canada. So I will share our contingency planning for that eventuality. Today’s payment ecosystem Let’s start with some basics regarding the current payment ecosystem. Most of what we think of as money today consists of bank deposits. And most payments—whether by debit, credit, direct transfer or cheque—involve the transfer of funds between banks or other financial institutions. Such transfers are supported by payment systems—the hardware and software that allow any financial institution to transfer funds to another. In Canada, these systems move more than $200 billion every business day. The Bank of Canada plays a distinct role in payments. This is because payments from one financial institution to another are finally settled through a transfer of funds between their accounts at the Bank of Canada. The Bank is also responsible for overseeing and regulating the whole system. In addition, we design, issue and distribute bank notes—the cash Canadians physically exchange with others to purchase goods and services. So let’s talk about cash. Cash is an old and simple payment technology. It has stood the test of time because it has several important advantages. First and foremost, cash is safe. It is legal tender with a relatively stable value and is widely accepted for payment. It also establishes confidence in the banking system. A bank’s customers can be reassured that, any time they want, they can convert their deposits into cash. Furthermore, cash is universally accessible. Anyone can use it, including people who don’t have bank accounts. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, cash is very important to those who may face challenges accessing alternative payment methods—such as the homeless and those living in remote communities. Cash is resilient—it works even when computer systems go down or during a power failure. It is private—you can buy everyday goods and services without revealing your identity or your personal or financial information. Cash also preserves an element of competition in the financial system, by providing a cheap and reliable alternative to credit and debit cards. All this being said, cash also has its limitations. It is more suitable for relatively low-value payments because of the obvious security risks of carrying around large volumes of cash. And it cannot be used to make purchases remotely. With this background in mind, I would like to discuss some issues that Canada’s payment ecosystem is currently facing. Changes and challenges Recent advances in technology offer opportunities to improve our core payment infrastructure. We have seen this at the retail level, with contactless “tap and go” payments, mobile banking and other innovations. The structure of our economy is also changing, with transactions increasingly taking place online. Partly reflecting these innovations, we are seeing a steady decline in the use of cash in retail transactions. In a 2017 Bank of Canada survey that asked Canadians how they pay for goods and services, respondents said that they use cash for about one-third of their transactions—compared with more than half just a decade ago. And about 1 in 10 Canadians now claims to be entirely “cashless.” 1 In some countries, such as Sweden and Norway, the use of cash has declined to a level where merchants are finding it too costly to accept cash, and banks are scaling back their processing services. I’ll talk later about how we can maintain access to cash, particularly for those “unbanked” or “underbanked” members of our society. In addition to these trends driven mainly by technology, globalization has put the spotlight on cross-border payments. Canadians who have family members in other countries often face high costs and long delays in sending them money. Businesses face similar drawbacks in paying for goods and services they purchase from outside Canada. These frictions and costs have motivated private digital currencies to aspire to make it easier and cheaper to move funds around. We are all familiar with the explosion of cryptocurrencies over the past few years. Bitcoin and similar digital assets were introduced with the hopes of becoming the money of the future. 2 That hasn’t happened, nor is it ever likely to. Transacting in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is just too expensive, and their purchasing power is too unstable. A more recent and potentially impactful innovation is so-called “stablecoins,” which are designed to maintain a stable value in terms of a currency or commodity. In most cases, they are backed—either fully or in part—by currency holdings. Compared with earlier forms of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have better prospects for widespread adoption—and, correspondingly, greater potential to further transform the world of money and payments. The most prominent example is Libra, a stablecoin that Facebook, along with an association of other companies, is planning to launch. Libra would run on an existing messaging platform with strong brand recognition. This would give it the potential to reach billions of people—including many with little or no access to banks or financial services. It’s tough to predict if Libra will ever live up to its promises or even come into existence. But it is a good example of a transformative technology that affects how the Bank needs to respond to the future of money. Building a modern ecosystem So let me now talk about some key areas where the Bank of Canada is focusing in order to adapt to this fast-moving world of payments. First, we are working to make sure that Canadians who wish to use bank notes can continue to do so. We are working with financial institutions to maintain a state-of-the-art distribution system for cash. This will help ensure that accepting cash remains cost-effective for merchants. Some other jurisdictions have adopted more prescriptive approaches, including laws requiring acceptance of cash at the point of sale. These approaches have both costs and benefits that should be further examined. A second area of focus is the Bank’s support for Payments Canada’s payment modernization efforts. The goal is to provide consumers, businesses and financial institutions with a modern, fast and convenient payment system. One exciting component of this project is the construction of a fast, always-on payment system called Real-Time Rail (RTR). This system is being designed with building blocks to meet consumers’ payment needs today and in the future. Based on this, you may imagine paying for groceries as you pick them off the shelf. Or ordering and paying at your favourite shawarma truck by tapping your phone to a code on the menu. The Bank is working with Payments Canada and stakeholders like Interac to ensure RTR is resilient and promotes competition and innovation in the Canadian payment ecosystem. To complement RTR, the government is exploring open banking—also known as consumer-directed finance. The intent of open banking is to give customers greater control of their financial data and safe access to a wider range of financial services, while reducing costs. This too would help foster a more innovative and competitive financial system. The government is also looking to implement a new Retail Payments Oversight Framework that will require payment service providers to beef up their risk management practices, and better protect end-users from losses. The Bank has been tapped as the regulatory authority to monitor compliance, including maintaining a public registry of regulated payment service providers. A third area of focus is an international one—cross-border payments. The Bank of Canada collaborated with the Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore to identify the “pain points” in cross-border payments. 3 Work on this topic is continuing through domestic and international forums, including the G20. It goes without saying that any improvements to moving money internationally would need to maintain vital safeguards—such as know-your-customer regulations—that detect and deter exploitation of the system for criminal or terrorist purposes. A fourth important area of focus is private digital currencies, some of which have been touted as the answer to the challenges of cross-border payments. While the future of Libra and other stablecoins is uncertain, private digital currencies are a global phenomenon. A global effort is required to understand the wide-ranging implications and ensure the regulatory framework is fit for purpose. To this end, the Bank of Canada is pleased to be working with the Financial Stability Board, alongside 23 other jurisdictions, to identify supervisory and regulatory issues posed by fintech innovations. 4 We are holding fast to the principles that innovation, competition and consumer choice are good, and that disruption is not the enemy. But it is essential to understand and manage the risks to individuals, businesses and the entire financial system that arise from any product offered to the public. Contingency planning for a central bank digital currency All of this leads me to my final area of focus. In the context of the issues I’ve raised today, there has been increasing discussion around a central bank digital currency (CBDC). We can think of this as a digital version of cash. Digital currencies are designed to provide the same benefits as cash—safety, universal access, resilience, privacy and competition—but in an electronic format that could be used for online transactions or at the point of sale, using a mobile phone or a special card or device. It would be truly equivalent to cash. Today we have released a comprehensive document that outlines in greater detail our recommendations with respect to a CBDC. I encourage you to visit our website and read some of our thinking, but I’ll share the highlights with you. We have concluded that there is not a compelling case to issue a CBDC at this time. Canadians will continue to be well-served by the existing payment ecosystem, provided it is modernized and remains fit for purpose. This means that: bank notes remain available to Canadians who want to use them, including marginalized populations in our society; the Canadian payment system is brought up to date and problems with cross-border payments are addressed; and an appropriate regulatory framework for stablecoins and other private digital currencies is established, both in Canada and globally. All this being said, the world can change very quickly. The Bank of Canada can imagine scenarios in which we would consider issuing a CBDC so we can continue to provide Canadians with trustworthy methods of payment. One scenario would be if we ever reach the tipping point where cash could no longer be used for a sufficiently wide range of transactions. That scenario would raise several potential concerns: payment services offered by large financial institutions could become the only game in town, giving them increased market power; people without adequate banking services would find it even more difficult to participate fully in the economy; people would lose the ability to conduct transactions privately; and the system could have a single point of failure, making it more vulnerable to computer system breakdowns and power outages. Of course, even such a shift toward a cashless society does not automatically mean the Bank would issue a CBDC. That’s a choice that Canadians and their elected representatives would need to make at the time. A second scenario that may lead to considering a CBDC is widespread use of private digital currencies. This could be one dominant digital currency created by a big tech company—a monopoly that would erode competition and privacy and pose an unacceptable challenge to Canadian monetary sovereignty. We could also imagine not one, but several, private digital currencies emerging. In this case, consumers and merchants would face an assortment of different methods of payment—reminiscent of a time before the Bank of Canada was created, when the country had multiple issuers of bank notes. In both scenarios, there would be an argument for the Bank of Canada to step in. The Bank would do this as a trusted public institution, creating an official digital currency that is designed with the interest of the public as its top priority, with no commercial motive. This last point is important, according to a poll published a few weeks ago by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. More than half of the people surveyed in 13 countries said they would prefer a digital currency issued by their central bank. Major internet technology companies ranked lowest in public confidence. 5 Beyond this, it is central to both our monetary sovereignty and the Bank’s ability to conduct monetary policy that we preserve our Canadian dollar as the unit of account—meaning that prices are quoted in Canadian dollars. That could be challenged if a private digital currency denominated in another currency, or basket of currencies, made serious inroads. Next steps So, where to next? While we don’t know what the future may bring, we need to move forward to work out what a potential CBDC might look like and how it could be managed, if the decision were ever taken to issue one. There are many aspects to consider in this contingency planning. How could a CBDC be integrated with other methods of payment yet be resilient so that it still works during a power failure, for example? What business model might work? Would the Bank try to develop it mainly in-house, or would it make more sense to partner with the private sector? How would a CBDC work for cross-border transactions? And, perhaps most importantly, how could we ensure that Canadians could continue to transact privately for legitimate purposes, while guarding against illicit activities like money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion? Answering these questions is part of our work. And we’re not alone—a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements covering 66 central banks found that about 80 percent of them are currently engaged in CBDC work and 10 percent are likely to issue a CBDC within three years. 6 We have formed a working group with the central banks of England, Japan, the European Union, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the Bank for International Settlements. We will use this platform to share experiences as we assess potential cases for a CBDC in our home jurisdictions. But a CBDC could only be launched successfully if Canadians want it. So we will be consulting with governments and key stakeholders in provinces and territories across Canada, like those of you in the audience today. We’ll also consider which design features might make a CBDC attractive as payment technologies and the financial system evolve. We will consult with payment service providers and merchants to ensure the business model is valid and roles are clear. In addition, we are consulting with various government agencies, recognizing that many areas relevant to a CBDC are outside the responsibility of the Bank of Canada. This will include discussions on how to combine privacy with adequate safeguards against illicit use. Another essential element is that the Bank would need proper legislative authority to issue a CBDC should the decision be made to issue one. In our work, we will continue to take a holistic view across the whole payment ecosystem to ensure that all aspects—payment systems, cash and any future CBDC—would continue to function together to provide Canadians with the efficient, safe and secure payment services they need. All of this will be undertaken while ensuring we manage any risks raised by a CBDC if a decision is ever taken to issue one—not just for the Bank of Canada but also for banks, payment service providers and end-users. Conclusion In conclusion, it is clear that technology is changing the world around us. And while we cannot perfectly predict the future, we can certainly plan for contingencies. This includes readying ourselves in case a decision is made some day to issue a Bank of Canada digital currency. Some out there may question why we would even need a CBDC when so much of our money appears to flow electronically now anyway. Let’s go back to the two scenarios I presented earlier that could warrant the launch of a CBDC. The first is where the use of physical cash is reduced or eliminated altogether. The second is where private cryptocurrencies make serious inroads. If either scenario came to pass, society may be well-served with a digital currency: that is designed, issued and distributed by an organization that is guided by the interest of the public good, rather than profit; that is safe, resilient, universally accessible and private—just like cash; and that is backed by a central bank’s balance sheet and its reputation for preserving the value of our money. Our intent would not be to issue a CBDC to replace bank notes or chartered bank deposits. The public still wants both of these products, and we will support them. In fact, we are actively planning for the design of a new $5 bank note. The Bank is in the midst of a wide consultation process to ask Canadians who they want as the portrait subject of this new bank note. And as the world changes, the Bank will continue to fulfill its mandate to support secure, reliable and efficient payment options that benefit all Canadians. Thank you for your time and attention this afternoon, and I look forward to your questions. I would like to thank Scott Hendry and Darcey McVanel for their help in preparing this speech. 1. C.

We’re looking ahead to imagine how we’ll pay for things in the future. Do you use cash? How often does the cashier just hand over the debit machine when you pay for your morning coffee? Some even seem surprised if you give them cash. Last year in Canada, people used cash for only 1 in 3 transactions. That’s down from more than half just 10 years ago. And Canada’s not alone. In many countries, people use cash less often. It’s hard to imagine this trend reversing—especially since cash isn’t an option when people shop online. And everyday, new competitors are showing up: payment platforms that offer speed, security and convenience. Financial technology—or fintech—is changing the way we pay for things around the world. Taking cash for granted When times are good, we keep most of our money in the bank, knowing we can access it 24/7 to pay for things electronically. But when the global financial system looks shaky—like it did in 2008—many people around the world turn to cash. That’s because central banks can’t fail like commercial banks do, so cash is the safest liquid financial asset. While deposit insurance acts as a key safeguard in the event of a commercial bank failure, it’s not a cure-all. There are limits on how much can be insured, and usually there’s a bit of a delay before your money is paid out. What about private digital currencies? Despite their claim of being the money of the future, current private digital currencies, like bitcoin, don’t work well for making payments or saving for the future. Because of their fluctuating values and slow clearing times, very few merchants accept them. It’s possible future digital currencies could at least partially solve these problems, leading to greater adoption. But widespread adoption of private digital currencies would carry important risks, to both the economy and the financial system. The issuer could go out of business, or fall victim to cybertheft If these situations occur, a loss of confidence in the payment system could ensue. Private digital currencies could even hurt our ability as a central bank to control inflation, and act as the lender of last resort. That’s because our policy tools, like the overnight interest rate and lending facilities, only work in Canadian dollars. If private digital currencies aren’t the answer, is there a better version of ultra-safe cash for the future? We’re taking note Research is underway at the Bank of Canada, because exploring the idea of a central bank digital currency makes sense. In theory, it could provide the safety of cash, with the convenience of modern electronic payments. It could take many forms, but two broad approaches are value-based—people transfer money from their bank account to a card or a phone app; or account-based—people and businesses can open an account at the central bank. Either way, payments made using a central bank digital currency could allow payments to remain private to the parties involved, just like cash; but traceable to law enforcement, just like bank accounts. Central bank digital currencies could give consumers more choice while maintaining competition among financial service providers like banks—the way cash does now. Depending on their design, they could even act as a backup if other payment methods become temporarily unavailable. Basically, central bank digital cash would act like current electronic payment methods. Only difference: it wouldn’t be tied to a commercial bank the way bank accounts and debit cards are. Rest assured, though, that even if we were to issue a digital currency, we wouldn’t stop printing cash. We will supply highly secure bank notes for as long as Canadians demand them. Important challenges along the way There would be some obstacles to think about on the path to a central bank digital currency. For example, people could decide to keep a large amount of their money in the central bank digital currency rather than in a regular bank account. The digital equivalent of putting money under the mattress, except easier. If people keep their money under their mattresses, so to speak, there could be: less money available for lending, or higher lending rates, or even both. Why? Because banks rely partly on deposits to make loans. So, it could become harder to get credit, like a mortgage or business loan. If businesses invest less as a result, productivity and innovation could suffer. That’s because innovation often happens when companies borrow to create new products and services. In other words, holding cash is safe, but it’s not very productive. There are ways to lower the risk. One example is to not earn interest on central bank digital currency, the way cash in your wallet doesn’t earn interest. This would make holding it in large amounts less appealing in normal times. But in difficult times, it could still act as a safe asset—just like cash. Other risks There could still be a problem, though: a central bank digital currency could increase the risk of a run on the banking system. A run on the system basically means that people rush to withdraw the money they hold from all commercial banks because they don’t know which banks are healthy and which ones are in trouble. But banks hold only a fraction of the total value of deposits in cash, so they typically can’t pay everyone at once. A central bank digital currency would make it easier and faster to transfer money out of commercial banks. So these system-wide runs could, in theory, become quicker and more frequent. We could end up in a situation where a central bank digital currency, instead of making the financial system more stable, makes it less so. Thankfully, runs on the entire banking system are extremely rare in modern times. In fact, Canada has never had one. We need to do more research Our experts are looking into the pros and cons of creating our own central bank digital currency. Creating a central bank digital currency is a pretty complicated decision. That’s why central bankers around the world, including us, are analyzing the pros and cons. We’re working to determine under which conditions it may make sense to, one day, issue a digital currency. Check out our latest research on digital currencies and new financial technologies .

Some of you here today may have purchased bitcoins or one of the other cryptocurrencies or products that have launched in recent years. I’m not here to give you investment advice about them. Rather, I want to share with you our current thinking about these virtual products. Investors worldwide have taken an increasing stake in them over the past few years, even as their market values have fluctuated widely. Around 2,000 crypto products are now available, with dozens more launching every month. 1 Trading volumes have grown almost 100-fold in just the past two years. Media interest in them has inflated at a similar pace, often including a thick layer of hype. The recent collapse in the market valuations of many cryptoassets—almost 40 per cent of those originally launched are now worthless—seems to have done little to dampen enthusiasm. 2 Some investors see these products as potentially world-changing; others as an example of “popular delusions and the madness of crowds.” 3 Possibly both are right. New financial or technological innovations often ignite market bubbles as users race to discover their most popular and profitable applications. Think of the “dot-com” bubble of the late 1990s, when prices of many Internet-related stocks shot into the stratosphere. While that period ended in tears for many investors, a handful of new companies that rose at that time, such as Google and Amazon, have brought about profound changes in the way we work, play, shop and live. The Bank of Canada is not responsible for regulating these crypto products. Indeed, the term “cryptocurrencies” is a misnomer. We prefer to call them “cryptoassets” because, as I will discuss in a moment, they don’t do a good job of performing the basic functions of money. But as they evolve, they may touch on the Bank of Canada’s core functions: monetary policy, financial stability, payments and currency. In my remarks today, I’ll put these crypto developments in context, discuss the need for globally harmonized regulations and highlight the Bank’s research and responses to public interest in cryptoassets. Currency and trust Bitcoin and many similar products were created in the hope that they would become the money of the future. How well do they stack up against the money of the past and present? This includes bank notes as well as bank deposits that can be accessed with a debit card or—for your parents’ generation—by cheque. 4 Let’s consider bank notes. One of our core functions at the Bank of Canada is to provide bank notes that Canadians can use with confidence. This is perhaps the most visible aspect of our work. We all take for granted that if you want to buy a coffee you can pay with cash. The coffee shop deposits the cash in the bank and uses the funds to pay for beans and baristas’ wages. The cash is universally accepted by all parties. Why is that? First, bank notes are a simple but effective technology for keeping track of who is paying how much to whom. Because a bank note is a physical thing, you can’t spend the same note twice. Many Canadians still prefer the simplicity of cash for small transactions. And cash works even when systems are down. Second, bank notes offer privacy for your transactions. You can use them without giving anyone your personal or banking information. Using cash avoids the risk of being hacked or having your card compromised. Privacy is a controversial attribute given that bank notes are a preferred medium of exchange for all kinds of illicit transactions. But for entirely legitimate reasons, most people place a high value on the privacy of their financial transactions. Third, we incorporate into our bank notes the most advanced security features to ensure they are difficult to fake and easy to authenticate. We also work closely with law-enforcement agencies to deter counterfeiting. Fourth, the acceptance of money is a matter of social convention. People accept cash as a means of payment because they know that others will do the same. This convention is enshrined in law: Canadians understand that we and the Royal Canadian Mint have a monopoly on the issuance of what’s called legal tender, the official money used in Canada. Finally, bank notes are denominated in dollars that offer stable purchasing power. The Bank of Canada helps preserve their value by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. Since the early 1990s, when we adopted our inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, we have maintained inflation close to the midpoint of our 1 to 3 per cent target range. This has allowed Canadians to make spending and investment decisions with the confidence that the future purchasing power of their money is secure and predictable. After a quarter century of successful inflation control in Canada, overall price stability has become the new norm. But some of us can recall the impact on households of spiralling inflation during the 1980s, when the interest rate on mortgages hit 20 per cent. Even today, while many countries have tamed inflation, some like Venezuela are coping with hyperinflation that is causing widespread hunger and hardship. The trust and confidence that Canadians have in our notes and in their purchasing power is based on our track record and reputation. Cryptoassets: what’s their story? So where do cryptoassets fit into this picture? Their proponents argue that the great benefit of Bitcoin and other forms of crypto cash is that they eliminate the need for public institutions like a central bank or large commercial banks. People using this system, they argue, don’t have to trust an individual or institution. That’s true, but they do have to trust the technology. Cryptoassets are so called because they use cryptography to validate transactions and prevent fraud. Records are kept through blockchain technology—a digital ledger stored on thousands of computers worldwide that keeps track of every coin or token issued. Anybody trying to fraudulently use their crypto cash multiple times will likely be caught by the validation process on all these computers. The use of encryption gives cryptoassets a similar level of privacy as bank notes. And they are as light and borderless as air. You can transfer them across town or across continents much more easily than you can a suitcase filled with $100 bills. A key feature of most cryptoassets is that their value is not tied to the dollar or other national currencies but has its own unit. Blockchain provides a mechanism for creating new tokens that makes it difficult to generate more in any way other than as prescribed by its underlying software. To create new units of value, cryptoassets must typically be “mined” by running energy-intensive computer computations. This is, in effect, a form of pre-programmed monetary policy: the purchasing power of the crypto tokens is determined by supply and demand, where the supply is limited by the enabling software. 5 This pre-programmed mechanism for creating cryptoassets was originally a key selling point. Those who believed that central banks could not be trusted to maintain the value of money were attracted by the idea of a money that is untouched by any public institution or individual. Ironically, this very mechanism has turned out to be its fundamental flaw. When the limited supply of tokens meets large flows of demand from enthusiasts, the result—as we have seen—is wild fluctuations in the value of cryptoassets. These fluctuations have drawn in even more speculative money, which has further amplified the price movements. Indeed, many Canadians who purchased bitcoins in 2017 reported that they did so for “investment” purposes—and that really means speculation. 6 The implication of these price movements is that the purchasing power of cryptoassets is far less stable than that of almost any sovereign money. The value of a bitcoin in US dollars topped $20,000 in the last year and is now down to around $6,000. Such wide price movements make it unlikely that the current crop of cryptoassets would ever be used as money for ordinary purposes when there is a stable national currency. Cryptoassets are also very expensive to use. Transaction costs were high in 2017—as much as $55 per transaction—compared with almost zero for cash. 7 These costs have come down since then, but if transaction volumes push the limits of the network again, costs will jump back up. In short, the current crop of cryptoassets is not about to replace the Canadian dollar or other national currencies. They are products that may be largely of interest to three kinds of users: investors, who should be fully aware of the risks they are taking; residents of countries where there is no trustworthy national currency; and those undertaking illicit transactions, including tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing, for which the property of pseudonymity makes them an ideal way to move funds. The crypto ecosystem So far, I have been talking about digital tokens launched with the ambition of becoming a form of currency. Now, many digital tokens are being created without any such ambition. Every month, dozens of new crypto products are launched through initial coin offerings (ICOs). In an ICO, investors purchase a new digital token in exchange for cash or for other, more established cryptoassets. Some of these resemble the initial public offerings that private companies use to raise capital by offering their stock to the public for the first time. In this way, they are like crowdfunding—a means to raise equity capital without jumping through all the regulatory hoops needed to issue publicly traded securities. Other ICOs offer the purchaser the right to use services on a platform that has yet to be built—and are thus more like the economic equivalent of a gift card. In yet other cases, the promised benefits to the purchaser are more nebulous. Those ICOs that function in a similar way as shares in a new company raise all the same issues as any other stock offering. Their value is based on the profits from some enterprise, so investors need to be able to verify that the enterprise actually exists and keep track of what it is doing with the funding it raises. In practice, ICOs have not always met that standard. For example, failure to meet funding targets hasn’t always resulted in the return of money to investors. And in cases where funding targets were exceeded, it’s not always clear how ICOs are using the extra money. Thus, while there are certainly advantages to a flexible, technologically advanced method of funding innovative enterprises, investors in ICOs need to be wary of fraud and misrepresentation. Given the steady introduction of new types, crypto products are often hard to classify. Many will prove to be short-lived. Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss all these innovations as fleeting fads. Some products may turn out to be smart and useful—by finding better, cheaper, more competitive ways of filling an actual need. If they do that, they could also challenge the existing business models of established financial institutions. For example, if the risks are properly managed, cryptoassets could potentially serve as a new funding tool, allowing small businesses to find the capital they need. Some also argue that cryptoassets could deliver financial services to segments of the population that are underserved by existing financial institutions. Even if the products themselves ultimately fail, they advance the development of technologies that are likely to be useful for a range of other purposes. Cryptoassets spurred the development of distributed ledger technology (DLT), which may have many valuable applications. At the Bank of Canada, through our Project Jasper, we have been exploring the potential use of DLT to streamline the settlement of financial transactions and the associated back-office activities. 8 This technology may have many other uses, such as registries for anything from land to commodities, trade finance and parolees in China. Although cryptoassets themselves exist only in cyberspace, they connect with the real economy and the financial system at various junctions—comprising a kind of crypto ecosystem. One point of contact is the direct use of these products to pay for goods and services over the Internet. A second is ICOs. Third, certain investment products in the mainstream financial system are linked in some way to the valuations of cryptoassets. These include derivatives contracts that have been launched on some commodity exchanges and exchange-traded funds. A fourth important point of contact is crypto exchanges, where cryptoassets are traded for money or for other cryptoassets. Crypto exchanges have been set up in different ways, which makes them hard to classify. Some exchanges have an economic function similar to banks: they hold cryptoassets on behalf of their clients, so the client gives up direct control of the cryptoassets themselves and has a claim on the exchange. 9 Other crypto exchanges function more like electronic trading platforms for cryptoassets. The regulatory arena The newness of crypto products and the fact that they claim to be delivering some of the same services provided by regulated financial institutions raises key questions. What risks could they pose? Should they be regulated? If so, how? As I mentioned earlier, the Bank of Canada is not responsible for regulating crypto products. Nonetheless, we have been examining their potential impact on the stability of Canada’s financial system. We’ve also been participating in international research on them, through the Financial Stability Board (FSB), G20 and G7. Regulators need to examine cryptoassets from a number of angles: the potential risks to the stability of the financial system, the integrity of markets and protection of investors, and protection against abusive financial flows such as money laundering and terrorist financing. The consensus of policy-makers is that crypto products do not yet pose financial stability risks. 10 This is in part because, despite their rapid growth, crypto products have a relatively small footprint in the financial system. The market capitalization of all cryptoassets was recently estimated at $230 billion and the volume of trading in these products at about $15 billion annually. While these seem like big numbers, they are dwarfed by other global financial markets: global equity markets alone have a market capitalization of around $100 trillion. Moreover, crypto products are not deeply interconnected with the mainstream financial system. For example, there is little evidence that commercial banks are investing in cryptoassets or accepting them as collateral. In this context, the immediate priorities are to address the other two issues I mentioned: investor protection and abusive financial flows. In these areas, the relevant regulators are working hard to adapt their frameworks to cover these new products. But things are evolving rapidly. Cryptoassets are growing in size, complexity and interconnectedness. As the underlying technologies and the design of crypto products evolve, we need to be ready to reassess how they might affect financial stability. Some potential aspects include the integrity of payment systems, bank business models, and the exposures of financial institutions and infrastructures. The FSB and related bodies are monitoring this evolution closely. Regulators also have to be forward-thinking about what kind of action may be required. That means putting in place a framework that is sufficiently adaptable so when new products emerge that potentially pose new risks, regulatory agencies will be ready. Crypto products are already regulated in many countries at the national or regional level. But in many jurisdictions the regulatory framework is far from complete. Also, given that cryptoassets are global in scope and not confined by borders, an emerging problem is the gaps between regulatory regimes. Different jurisdictions have adopted different regulatory approaches, depending on how they have defined these assets. When a new product is launched, is it classified as a payment instrument, a security, a commodity or none of the above? Should crypto exchanges be called banks, financial market infrastructures or something else? These classifications differ across jurisdictions and in some cases remain nebulous. Beyond these differences in classification, the regulatory treatment of these assets differs. In China, the response has been to ban them. In Japan, authorities are creating a framework to manage the risks associated with their growth. Such differences among regulations globally, together with the incompleteness of regulation in many jurisdictions, open room for promoters to engage in regulatory arbitrage, developing new products to exploit them. Regulators must decide how far they need to go in harmonizing their approaches with other countries. Differences in the regulatory treatment of these products for controlling money laundering and terrorist financing are a particularly pressing concern. Such factors pose key challenges for regulatory agencies. Data and a consistent means of collecting them are required to assess emerging risks. And an agreed system is needed to classify new products by their attributes and economic functions. At the same time, we need to avoid regulation that is so heavy-handed or cumbersome that it stifles innovation. New crypto products could deliver more of what the public wants and bring more competition and financial inclusion to the system. Developments in this space could spur the growth of technologies that have important positive spinoffs. These concerns must be carefully balanced. The regulatory framework in Canada is still a work in progress, but a number of steps have been taken by the federal and provincial governments, which share jurisdiction in this area. In 2014, the federal government amended Canada’s anti-money laundering legislation to include businesses dealing in cryptoassets. Regulations based on the legislation are now being finalized. The Canada Revenue Agency also published a note on the tax laws that apply to cryptoassets. And the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada has a useful backgrounder on the risks and tips for using cryptoassets. At the provincial level, the Canadian Securities Administrators issued a staff notice in 2017 on crypto offerings, warning investors about issues such as volatility, transparency, valuation, custody and liquidity, as well as the use of unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. The notice also offers guidance on the applicability of securities laws and what steps businesses should take if they are raising capital through ICOs. Central bank digital currency At the Bank of Canada, we are also considering the potential implications of these developments for our own core functions. In particular, we are assessing how we could respond if cryptoassets were to evolve in a way that undermines our ability to provide Canadians with a means of payment with stable purchasing power that they can use with confidence. This is related to our ability to implement effective monetary policy as well as to the security and finality of settlement we provide through our bank notes. While we do not have any doubts currently about our ability to fulfill our mandate, contingency planning is important: the changes driven by technology may be rapid. In this context, one of our priorities is to explore under what conditions, if any, we might recommend to the government that we issue our own digital currency. At the same time, we are studying key design questions related to a central bank digital currency (CBDC), such as what form it might take and whether it would be anonymous like cash. As it turns out, the questions of “under what conditions” and “in what form” are closely intertwined. The design of a CBDC has important implications for its risks and benefits. For example, some major reasons for caution about a central bank digital currency are concerns that it could become a vehicle for illicit transactions or that it could have significant negative implications for financial intermediation. Unless such risks could be managed through appropriate design, the Bank would not recommend issuing such a currency. Ultimately, then, this exploration is going to require a unique combination of economics, technology and business strategy as well as thorough consultations with all stakeholders. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team to do this work and will provide more details as the research unfolds. We are also exchanging information with other central banks, notably the Swedish Riksbank, which is well along in examining CBDCs. The results of our work in this area are available on a special page on our website. 11 Conclusion It’s important that Canadians benefit from financial products and services that are better, cheaper and more flexible. At the same time, we will continue to keep a close eye on the risks associated with cryptoassets. We are working with our domestic and international partners to ensure they do not pose a risk to the Canadian or global financial system. Canadians need universal access to means of payment that they can trust. As advances in technology open up new opportunities and transform the financial system, we at the Bank of Canada will continue to do what is needed to maintain that trust.

He also talks about structural change ahead, shifts in global trade and ensuring monetary policy is fit for the future. The emergence of inflation targeting Following World War II, central banks around the world tried different strategies to control inflation. But global inflationary pressures continued to build. Then, when oil prices jumped in the 1970s after steep production cuts, inflation surged in many countries. To counter fast-rising prices, Canada and others tried to cap wage and price increases. But as soon as those controls were removed, inflation shot back up. Some countries tried to tame inflation by curbing the growth of money. This method also failed. And inflation continued to rise. Central banks needed a way to control inflation that was: simple—relatively easy to do and easy for the public to understand flexible—able to work under a variety of domestic and international conditions able to control inflation over time, while still allowing prices to adjust with supply and demand Inflation targeting fit the bill. Since Canada introduced its inflation-targeting framework in the early 1990s, inflation has mostly stayed close to the 2% target. The post-pandemic surge in inflation tested the framework like never before. But the framework succeeded, and the Bank of Canada got inflation back to target without causing a recession. More shocks and change ahead The world is changing. Some trends that have supported global economic growth over the past few decades—such as favorable demographics and globalization—are now slowing or reversing. Supply shocks are expected to become more frequent. This will likely lead to more volatile inflation. The dramatic shifts in US trade policy and steep new tariffs have also increased uncertainty. Global supply chains are shifting as businesses around the world look for new suppliers, new markets and new pathways to trade. Monetary policy cannot solve the trade conflict. Nor can it alter the reality of structural change and more frequent supply shocks. But central banks can adapt to confront these new realities. At the Bank, we are adjusting in several ways, including: Increasing our use of surveys and non-traditional data to complement the traditional data we’ve always used. Doing more outreach. We meet with businesses and communities across Canada to better understand how economic conditions are affecting their regions and industries. Improving the models we use for forecasting. Using scenarios to better understand how different variables—such as tariff rates—could affect our economy. These adjustments give us a more complete picture of the economy. That helps us make better policy decisions. To prepare for more structural change and greater volatility, central bankers need to reduce uncertainty where we can and manage it where we can’t.” To prepare for more structural change and greater volatility, central bankers need to reduce uncertainty where we can and manage it where we can’t.” Future-proofing our framework Canada’s inflation-targeting framework has worked well over the past few decades. But we still need to review our framework every few years to ensure it is fit for the future. Our next framework renewal is in 2026. The review is currently underway. Given that we expect more shocks and uncertainty in the future, we are asking three broad questions: How can we best use the flexibility built into our framework when faced with supply shocks? How should we measure core inflation and use it to inform our policy decisions? How does monetary policy affect the housing sector, and how should we consider the affordability of housing in our focus on overall price stability? One question we are not asking in this review is whether 2% is the right target for inflation. Our target has proven its worth in keeping inflation low and stable over time.

This is a significant milestone in a storied history that has spanned the Great Depression and the surge in silver prices, post-World War II stabilization, central bank independence and, finally, flexible inflation targeting. For many central banks, including Banco de México and the Bank of Canada, flexible inflation targeting 1 has become our guiding light, helping us to achieve our monetary policy mandates. So far, it has been more successful and more durable than anything that came before. But the evolution of monetary policy didn’t end with the adoption of inflation targeting. And to continue to deliver for the people we serve, central banks need to periodically review our frameworks to ensure they are still fit for purpose. In my remarks today, I’ll begin by recalling some of the frameworks of the past, how the pitfalls of those frameworks led to inflation targeting and how inflation targeting has performed over the past few decades. Then I’ll consider some of the structural changes underway in economies across the globe. Big structural changes don’t happen smoothly and there are often shocks along the way. So I’ll discuss what monetary policy can and cannot do in a more shock-prone world. And I’ll share the ways the Bank of Canada is adapting how we implement flexible inflation targeting to confront new realities, including more frequent supply disruptions and elevated uncertainty. Finally, I’ll come back to the idea of periodically reviewing the framework to ensure it is still the best way to meet our objectives. In Canada, we are reviewing our monetary policy framework now to prepare for its renewal next year. I’ll outline the questions we are asking ourselves, particularly against the backdrop of this more shock-prone world. Perhaps I’ll spoil it a bit by telling you that one thing we aren’t revisiting this time around is the 2% inflation target itself. Inflation targeting as a way to do better To understand where we are, it’s important to understand where we came from. After World War II, central banks stopped pegging their currencies to the price of gold and, together with their national governments, tried different ways to stabilize the economy and inflation. For a while, inflation stayed low and relatively stable in most major economies. But by the late 1960s, global inflationary pressures began to build. And when major oil-producing countries sharply cut production in 1973, the shock to oil prices caused inflation to surge in much of the world. In Canada, as in many other countries, the government resorted to wage and price controls. These controls generally worked to hold down inflation while they were in place. But they did little to address the underlying causes of inflation. So once the controls were removed, inflation jumped back up. And keeping prices artificially low led to shortages. To try to address the root causes of inflation, many central banks turned to money growth targeting. Since “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” 2 the favoured solution of the time was to suppress money growth. From 1975 to 1981, monetary policy in Canada was guided by a series of successively lower growth targets for M1—a narrow measure of money consisting mainly of physical currency and funds held in chequing accounts. Monetary policy successfully reduced M1 growth, achieving every target. But inflation continued to rise. The framework failed because the relationship between money, prices and income was not stable. As Bank of Canada Governor Gerald Bouey famously put it, “We didn’t abandon M1, M1 abandoned us.” 3 Some countries adopted a fixed exchange rate framework—pegging their currency to that of a larger country to control inflation. Of course, this worked only if the larger country successfully controlled inflation. There was also the added problem of instability, particularly when policies in different countries were not aligned. As you know well, Mexico fixed its exchange rate to the US dollar for many decades. But the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980s led to budget shortfalls, and the central bank expanded the supply of money to finance the deficit. That, combined with the devaluation of the currency, led to a surge in inflation. Structural reforms in the late 1980s helped, but price pressures stayed elevated. Clearly, the monetary policy frameworks of the day were not delivering price stability. Central banks needed something different, and their wish list was clear: The framework had to be simple—targeting intermediate variables, such as money growth, had proven to be too complicated. It had to be flexible—central banks needed to be able to gear monetary policy to conditions in their own country. And it had to control inflation over time, while still allowing individual prices to adjust with shifts in demand and supply. Inflation targeting combined with a floating exchange rate fit these criteria. 4 In 1990, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the first central bank to adopt inflation targeting. Nine months later, in 1991, the Bank of Canada was the second. At that time, I was a newly minted PhD doing research and analysis at the Bank. I can tell you it was an exciting time as we figured out how to take inflation targeting from an unproven concept to a full-fledged monetary policy framework that worked both in theory and in practice. Along the way, many other central banks joined us, including Banco de México. Since those early days, inflation targeting has proven to be a big success. Take Canada and Mexico. In the 25 years leading up to the pandemic, inflation in Canada averaged very close to the 2% target and was inside the 1% to 3% band about 80% of the time. By comparison, in the 25 years before that, inflation averaged just above 6% and was much more variable. Here in Mexico, inflation averaged 130% in 1987. The 3% target was adopted in 2002 with a band of 2% to 4%. From the early 2000s to the pandemic, inflation averaged about 4%. In both our countries, inflation targeting led to much lower and more stable inflation. Inflation targeting has also made central banks’ ability to deliver price stability more credible, making the framework resilient. Over time, inflation expectations have become better centred on the target and less sensitive to short-run fluctuations in inflation. This has been reinforced by a transformation in how central banks engage with the public. Inflation targeting is inherently transparent—the central bank sets a numerical target for inflation and publicly commits to achieving that target. The central bank also explains how its monetary policy actions will achieve the target. This creates accountability. When central banks are clear about their objective, explain how they will achieve that objective and then deliver on it, that builds credibility. In Canada, the pandemic tested our framework like never before. We faced huge shocks to both demand and supply, a deep recession and then a rapid rebound. As the economy reopened, inflation rose sharply, hitting 8.1%—a 40-year high. To be clear, this was not a failure of the framework. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine was unforeseeable, and we misjudged the strength and persistence of inflation in 2021 and early 2022. But once it was clear that high inflation was not temporary, the framework guided our response, and we raised the policy interest rate forcefully to bring inflation down. It was a painful adjustment for many Canadians, but in the summer of 2024 inflation returned to 2%. And we got there without causing a recession or major job losses. The credibility of our 2% target was the foundation for this success. While short-term inflation expectations in Canada rose temporarily when the inflation crisis hit, long-term inflation expectations remained anchored. After we started raising interest rates and inflation began to ease, short-term expectations normalized. We told Canadians our actions would reduce inflation and then they saw inflation start to come down. This reinforced the credibility of our target and made it easier to get inflation all the way back to 2%. The experience here in Mexico was similar. Indeed, I want to salute Banco de México for raising interest rates ahead of the Bank of Canada and many other central banks. Your timely and decisive response made your economy resilient to the pressures of high inflation and helped ensure that long-term inflation expectations remained anchored. Your actions reinforced the credibility of your target. My point here is that the measure of success is more than whether inflation stays at the target. It’s also how the framework performs in the face of big shocks like a global pandemic. More structural change and uncertainty This brings me to where we are today. The world is changing. The structural tailwinds of peace, globalization and favourable demographics are turning into headwinds, and the world looks increasingly prone to shocks. Elevated sovereign debt, slower economic growth and lagging productivity also make our economies more vulnerable. These vulnerabilities are compounded by intensifying geopolitical risks and more frequent climate events. In addition, new technologies—including artificial intelligence—are set to disrupt existing industries and create new ones. On top of these structural shifts, the rules of global trade are being overturned. Steep new US tariffs and the unpredictability of US policy have reduced economic efficiency and increased uncertainty. As the United States’ biggest trading partners, Mexico and Canada are particularly affected. With businesses in both our countries looking for new suppliers and new markets, cross-border supply chains are shifting. Headwinds that limit supply could mean more upward pressure on inflation going forward. And more frequent supply shocks could mean more variability in inflation. Unfortunately, monetary policy cannot undo the economic impacts of the structural shifts ahead. Nor can it offset the hit to efficiency from higher tariffs and the reconfiguration of trade. And we can’t reduce the uncertainty caused by the policies of other countries or by shocks that are outside our control. But we can work to improve our understanding of these supply shocks and their impacts on our economies. We can also adapt our analysis, our decision-making and our communication to confront elevated uncertainty. What we can’t do is let increased volatility and elevated economic uncertainty sow doubts about our commitment to price stability. Let me expand. Improving information and models of the supply side At the Bank of Canada, we’ve increased our use of non-traditional data and surveys to better understand how businesses and consumers are adapting to structural change and shifts in US policy. We have also stepped up our outreach across Canada. My colleagues on the Bank’s Governing Council and I regularly travel to different regions of the country to meet with community and business leaders. We get to see first-hand how economic disruptions are affecting people and impacting business decisions. This, in turn, allows us to make more informed policy decisions. We are also investing in new economic models that capture what is happening in specific sectors of the economy and the interconnectivity between sectors. We’re developing these new models because our existing models were ill-equipped for the COVID‑19 shock. Those models focused on the overall economy, which was in excess supply during that period, so they missed the inflationary consequences of bottlenecks and shortages in certain sectors. Recent events—from geopolitical tensions to US tariffs—have only reinforced the need for models that can help us evaluate how sectoral disruptions affect the broader economy and what that could mean for monetary policy. Managing uncertainty in an unpredictable world Better information and analysis can reduce uncertainty, but they won’t offset the fundamental unpredictability of a more shock-prone world. If we can’t avoid uncertainty, we need to accept it and manage it as best we can. When faced with elevated uncertainty, point forecasts for where the economy and inflation are headed become less useful as a guide. This means two things. First, when the future is more clouded, we naturally put more weight than usual on recent data until we have a better sense of how the economy is responding to new shocks. And second, we put less weight on the base-case projection and more weight on the risks. Here, scenarios can help. Scenarios allow us to examine how our economy could evolve depending on different assumptions about key unknowns. Different assumptions can point to different economic effects, allowing us to consider how monetary policy could respond in each case. This helps us understand how our policy decisions will hold up across a range of outcomes. Let me give you an example. At our last few interest rate decisions at the Bank of Canada, we used scenarios rather than conventional forecasts because US trade policy was simply too unpredictable. In April, we considered two scenarios—one with high US tariffs and retaliatory tariffs around the world, and one with modest tariffs and little retaliation. In July, we considered three scenarios—one based on tariffs that were in place or had been agreed as of late July, a second with much higher tariffs and a third with lower tariffs. 5 By using scenarios, we were able to take a monetary policy decision that would fit a range of economic outcomes. The scenarios also highlighted just how important the Canada–United States–Mexico trade relationship is for the Canadian economy. Enhancing our decision-making and communication We have also adapted our governance and communication. In a world with more supply shocks, we face more hard choices—we can’t stabilize inflation and output at the same time. And when we are faced with more uncertainty, the likelihood of our getting things wrong is higher. Hard choices and uncertainty increase the risk of public disappointment, frustration and criticism. That’s why it’s important for central banks to remain independent from the political process. But we can’t hide behind our independence. We need to draw on a diversity of views, and we need to be transparent and accountable in everything we do. At the Bank of Canada, we’ve added two external Deputy Governors to our Governing Council. And we’ve improved transparency by holding a press conference after every interest rate decision, releasing a summary of our policy deliberations and expanding our media presence. High inflation in 2022 was a reminder that even though inflation was low and stable for years before the pandemic, central banks cannot take public trust for granted. We need to constantly earn that trust—by being clear about our objectives, accountable for our actions and humble in the face of uncertainty. A framework fit for purpose We’ve been targeting inflation for almost 35 years in Canada. Every five years we review and renew our monetary policy framework with the federal government. These reviews are a strength of our system. They give us the opportunity to assess performance and consider whether our current framework remains the best one for the future. Our last renewal was in 2021, so the next one is coming in 2026. Ahead of this review, we took a close look at our policy response to the pandemic emergency, particularly our use of exceptional policies. 6 It’s important we take on board the lessons of the pandemic so that we're ready for future crises. For our framework review, we are asking three sets of questions. First, in a world more prone to supply shocks, what are the implications for inflation and the economy? How should monetary policy respond? When should we look through supply shocks and when should we lean against them or even into them? Should our response depend on the size and persistence of the shock, or on the state of the economy? In short, how can we best use the flexibility in the framework in the face of supply shocks? Second, with more supply shocks and greater volatility in inflation, what is the best way to measure core inflation? At the Bank of Canada, we’ve used various measures of core inflation over the past few decades. And in practice we often use an even broader range of indicators to assess underlying inflation. Going forward, what’s the best approach—narrow or broad—and what are the best indicators? The third set of questions relates to the interaction between monetary policy, housing affordability and inflation. Many Canadians are struggling to find affordable housing, a common issue across many countries, including Mexico. Monetary policy cannot directly increase the supply of housing—that’s an issue for elected governments. But, through interest rates, monetary policy does have a direct effect on the demand for housing. And housing is a big part of the consumer price index in Canada, so the cost of housing affects inflation. Therefore, it’s worth examining how monetary policy affects housing sector dynamics, and how best to factor housing affordability into our focus on overall price stability. As I said at the start of my remarks, there’s one key question we won’t be asking this time around. In our reviews since 1995, we’ve repeatedly asked whether 2% is the right target. We’ve considered whether the target should be lower or higher. We’ve also weighed alternatives to inflation targeting, including price-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting. Each time, we’ve concluded that targeting 2% inflation is the right framework for us. The experience since the last renewal in 2021 has only reinforced this conclusion. The 2022 spike in inflation was a painful reminder of just how much Canadians don’t like high inflation. We also know that Canadians generally understand and support the 2% target. That familiarity has helped anchor inflation expectations through thick and thin, including through the pandemic crisis. In short, the 2% target has proven its worth in achieving price stability over time. We are already facing a more uncertain and unpredictable world. Now is not the time to question the target. Conclusion It’s time for me to wrap up. Inflation targeting has worked well for central banks over the past few decades. It was tested by the global financial crisis, the pandemic and the post-pandemic surge in inflation. Unlike the monetary policy frameworks that came before, inflation targeting has proven durable—a framework for all seasons. As Banco de México embarks on its next century, that is something to celebrate. Central banks are at their best when they learn from the past and prepare for the future. To prepare for more structural change and greater volatility, central bankers need to reduce uncertainty where we can and manage it where we can’t. This means better information and richer models. It means putting more weight on the risks and considering monetary policy that is robust to more than one outcome. It means being open, accountable and free of political influence. This is how we build and maintain the trust of the people we serve. We need to earn that trust every day. The Bank of Canada and Banco de México have a long history of working together, and your expertise has been an invaluable resource to us on many occasions. So I am honoured that you invited me here today to celebrate this historic occasion with you. Your centennial is a testament to the rich history of central banking around the world. If I can leave you with one message today, it is that in a more uncertain world, the value of public confidence in central banks and our ability to deliver price stability is greater than ever. Thank you. I would like to thank Jing Yang, Oleksiy Kryvtsov, Louis Poirier and Kun Mo for their help in preparing this speech.",html,2026-01-07 09:32:37,,,,,

We also leverage the rich demographic information available in the CSCE to construct summary indicators for different groups defined by characteristics such as age, home-ownership status and income. We show that there is significant heterogeneity across different demographic groups. This heterogeneity helps us understand how economic shocks disproportionately impact some households. Finally, we investigate which macroeconomic variables drive changes in the CSCE indicator and show that the fundamental drivers vary over time.

We explore ideas such as new facilities that ease asset managers’ ability to convert existing assets to cash or new assets with liquidity that central banks would guarantee.,"Will asset managers dash for cash? A summary of the implications for central banks Dealers in Canadian fixed-income markets tend to match their clients’ orders to buy or sell securities. However, when several asset managers need cash at the same time, market liquidity relies increasingly on dealers’ willingness to buy securities and hold them on their own balance sheets. When this happens, selling liquid securities to generate cash becomes costly for asset managers. Thus, asset managers may occasionally anticipate a potential limit in dealers’ capacity to hold securities and decide to sell securities as a precaution. In severe scenarios, this precautionary selling of securities can spread across market participants and lead to a dash for cash, overwhelming dealers’ balance sheet capacity, and warrant central bank interventions. The onset of the COVID‑19 crisis is one example of when a dash for cash occurred in Canada. The net sales of Government of Canada (GoC) bonds to dealers by their clients increased to over $5 billion between March 9 and March 20, 2020. The cost of selling the bonds quadrupled ( Chart 1 ). In our full staff discussion paper (Cimon et al. 2025), we argue that this sale of bonds to dealers was relatively small compared with its impact on market liquidity. We also point out that there were other indications in markets for bankers’ acceptances and GoC treasury bills that signalled dealers were approaching a limit in their willingness to buy securities. Financial market conditions started to normalize only after the Bank of Canada intervened to support Canadian financial markets. The Contingent Term Repo Facility (CTRF) is the Bank’s existing facility for providing liquidity support to asset managers in periods of market-wide stress. In 2024, the Bank of Canada reviewed and updated its CTRF policy to incorporate lessons learned from the COVID‑19 pandemic. These changes, highlighted in Chen, Chu and Kinnear (2025) , should increase asset managers’ readiness to draw on the facility in stress and further reduce the likelihood of precautionary asset sales. The updated CTRF: identifies high-quality securities that will be accepted clarifies eligibility criteria for asset managers enhances readiness through pre-approved counterparties and regular testing establishes a formal risk assessment and governance process The review also explored three broad areas where policy-makers could take actions to reduce the risk of a dash for cash: strengthening the regulation of asset managers’ liquidity risk management practices reinforcing the resilience of the fixed-income market structure expanding the central banks’ tools In our discussion paper, we focus on two broad ways to adapt the central bank tool kit to reduce the likelihood of a dash for cash. Central banks could: introduce standing facilities for asset managers to guarantee the degree of liquidity of existing bonds or assets under all market conditions create new assets that asset managers can always use to meet cash needs The aim of each of these options would be to provide asset managers with access to cash that does not depend on dealer capacity. These potential new assets or facilities would help asset managers insure themselves against some of their liquidity risks. Equipped with a more resilient buffer of liquid securities, asset managers would have greater confidence that they could meet future uncertain cash needs. This could reduce the need for precautionary asset sales by asset managers. By reducing the probability of such precautionary asset sales, these facilities could also reduce the likelihood that a central bank faces market conditions that require broad, large and rapid asset purchases. The evolution of the balance between the potential demand for liquidity from asset managers, on the one hand, and dealers’ ability to provide it, on the other, will determine whether enhancing the tool kit may eventually be necessary. Central banks have both the mandate and the tools to mitigate a dash for cash. However, despite their effectiveness, central bank interventions involve trade-offs that may become more significant if the likelihood of a dash for cash increases. When deciding to expand the tool kit, central banks should also assess unintended consequences, including potential: implications for the conduct of monetary policy market distortions due to a larger central bank footprint in the economy moral hazard for asset managers",html,2026-01-07 09:32:37,,,,,

Unlike in some other jurisdictions where investor outflows likely amplified stresses, Canadian MMFs experienced inflows during the March 2020 market turmoil.","An update on the Canadian money market mutual fund sector Introduction Money market mutual funds, also called money market funds (MMFs), are open-ended mutual funds that hold cash and invest in short-term, high-quality debt securities. They aim to provide their investors with stable returns and high liquidity and allow the daily withdrawal of funds. Investors use MMFs for different reasons, including: to park cash between investments to place their money in a safe investment during periods of market turmoil to earn higher interest than traditional deposit accounts MMFs facilitate credit intermediation by moving cash from households and institutions to borrowers such as governments and corporations. Thus, they provide an important source of short-term funding. Despite their benefits, MMFs can pose vulnerabilities to the financial system, particularly through: Liquidity mismatch: MMFs offer daily redemptions, but some of their assets may be difficult to sell quickly without losses during periods of market stress. First-mover advantage: Liquidity mismatch can motivate investors to redeem ahead of others to avoid potential losses from funds selling assets at discounted prices to meet redemptions. In several notable cases, these vulnerabilities have resulted in MMFs amplifying market stresses. For instance, during both the 2008–09 global financial crisis and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, some MMFs in the United States faced sudden and large investor withdrawals (Anadu et al. 2021). These outflows led those MMFs to sell their holdings in secondary markets. This likely contributed to liquidity strains in short-term funding markets and reduced the capacity of MMFs to fund governments and corporations. In response to instances like these, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) launched a comprehensive review of MMF vulnerabilities. This review resulted in policy recommendations aimed at enhancing MMFs’ resilience. Since then, MMFs have remained a global focus for financial stability, and the FSB has been tracking the progress on implementing the recommendations across jurisdictions (FSB 2021; FSB 2024). In light of the global attention on MMFs, we examine the Canadian MMF sector. This sector has grown by 180% since 2019, yet it remains less than 3% of the overall Canadian mutual fund sector. Despite the small size of the MMF sector, MMFs hold around 5% of Government of Canada (GoC) treasury bills and 11% of non-government short-term paper. The relatively large presence of MMFs in these markets suggests that MMFs could have a significant impact on liquidity conditions. However, during the market turmoil in March 2020, when MMF outflows in several jurisdictions around the world amplified market stress, Canadian MMFs experienced inflows. This relative stability may reflect the fact that, compared with other jurisdictions, Canada’s MMF sector has a larger share of retail investors. Retail investors may have more stable behaviour than institutional investors, who may liquidate their MMF positions relatively quickly because of a sudden need for cash. Our analysis aligns with earlier work done by the FSB in which Canada was not identified as a jurisdiction where MMF vulnerabilities could raise significant financial stability concerns. However, given the ongoing international focus on MMFs and their growing role in key short-term funding markets, Bank of Canada staff will continue to periodically review the sector. Money market mutual funds have experienced high growth In Canada, MMF assets have grown by 180% since 2019, exceeding the growth rates of life insurers, pension funds and other types of mutual funds ( Chart 1 ). The size of MMFs has generally moved in line with the Bank’s target for the policy rate, suggesting that their recent growth could be related to higher interest rates ( Chart 2 ). However, this trend appears to correlate with some lag, and there have been some brief periods—particularly during times of high market turmoil—when this relationship was less clear. Although the policy rate has been declining since mid-2024, the amount of MMF assets has continued to increase, likely because interest rates remain high relative to historical levels. High interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding cash in deposit accounts at commercial banks, which typically offer low interest rates. When rates are high, investors are more likely to shift their cash into investment products that: have returns that more closely track the level of interest rates than deposit accounts at commercial banks do remain liquid compared with other investment products (Nagel 2016; Nikolaou 2025) Indeed, during the recent years of higher interest rates, while MMF assets grew, so did other comparable products such as guaranteed investment certificates and high-interest savings account exchange-traded funds. Despite their rapid growth, MMFs remain relatively small, with total assets around $100 billion ( Chart 2 ). This represents only about 3% of the overall Canadian mutual fund sector. 1 Chart 1: Money market funds have experienced more growth than other asset managers Chart 2: Growth of money market funds broadly correlates with interest rate levels Money market mutual funds are large holders of Canadian money market securities Despite the small size of the MMF sector, as MMFs have grown, so has their presence in certain Canadian short-term funding markets. Chart 3 shows that MMFs now hold: 5% of GoC treasury bills, a larger share than either life insurers or pension funds, though other mutual funds combined hold approximately 13% 11% of non-government short-term paper, such as commercial paper, surpassing the holdings of other mutual funds, life insurers and pension funds, individually Chart 3: Money market funds hold a large share of Government of Canda treasury bills and non-government short-term paper Within MMFs’ holdings of non-government short-term paper, commercial paper has represented an increasingly large share since the phase-out of the Canadian bankers’ acceptance (BA) market (CFIF 2023). From 2022 to 2023, MMFs allocated between 10% and 20% of their assets to BAs. However, starting in June 2023, MMFs reduced their holdings of BAs and simultaneously increased their holdings of commercial paper from around 45% to 60% of their assets ( Chart 4 ). Overall, MMFs’ growing presence in the GoC treasury bill and commercial paper markets suggests that liquidity in these short-term funding markets could be vulnerable to the trading activity of MMFs, particularly in scenarios where MMFs may sell these assets to meet investor withdrawals. Chart 4: Money market funds have increased their allocation to commercial paper Money market mutual funds did not face net redemptions in March 2020 In this section, we take a close look at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis to assess whether investor withdrawals at MMFs in Canada could have contributed to turmoil in financial markets, as was the case in some other jurisdictions. We find that Canadian MMFs did not experience net investor outflows in March 2020. Rather, they saw approximately $4 billion in net inflows—the largest monthly net flow, positive or negative, in our sample since 2014 ( Chart 5 ). Even within the month of March 2020, MMFs consistently saw inflows, except for a short period between March 9 and 11. 2 Notably, these inflows rose in tandem with the spread between one-month BAs and the Canadian overnight index swap rate, a proxy for short-term funding conditions. An absence of investor withdrawals while short-term funding conditions deteriorated suggests that MMF outflows did not amplify these stresses, unlike the case in some other jurisdictions. Chart 5: During the March 2020 financial market turmoil, Canadian money market funds experienced investor inflows The stability of the MMF sector in March 2020 could be due to its investor base. In jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom and the euro area, where MMFs have posed greater financial stability risks, institutional investors make up 80%–90% of the investor base (FSB 2024). In contrast, in Canada, retail investors dominate. Chart 6 shows that in 2024, institutional investors held only 14% of the total assets of Canadian MMFs, while retail investors held 65%. The remaining 21% of MMF assets were held by other investment funds. 3 Retail investors in MMFs generally exhibit lower sensitivity to market conditions and may be less likely than institutional investors to quickly withdraw their cash. For instance, large asset managers, who may have a greater need for cash during periods of turmoil, are more likely than retail investors to liquidate their positions in MMFs to meet margin calls or to build up their liquidity buffers to adhere to their risk limits (FSB 2024). Chart 6: Retail investors represent the largest share of Canadian money market fund investors Conclusion Canadian MMFs are small relative to the size of the financial system, yet they play a significant role as investors in certain short-term funding markets. Nevertheless, we find that, unlike in some other jurisdictions, MMFs in Canada did not experience large investor outflows during the COVID-19 crisis. This stability may be supported by the predominantly retail investor base of Canadian MMFs, which contrasts with the situation in some other jurisdictions. References Anadu, K., M. Cipriani, R. M.

The 2025 edition highlights a decline in the US-dollar value of sovereign debt in default and provides more data about defaults on China’s official loans.","BoC–BoE Sovereign Default Database: What’s new in 2025? Introduction Since 2014, the Bank of Canada (BoC) has maintained a comprehensive database of sovereign defaults to systematically measure and aggregate the nominal value of the different types of sovereign government debt in default. The database draws on published datasets compiled by various public and private sector sources. It combines elements of these sources with new information to develop comprehensive estimates of stocks of government obligations in default. These include bonds and other marketable securities, as well as bank loans and official loans, valued in US dollars, for the years 1960 to 2024, on both a country-by-country and a global basis. We consider debt to be in distress—and effectively in default—when an interruption in scheduled debt service occurs, a sovereign seeks to renegotiate the existing contract terms of any of its obligations or a combination of both. Such restructurings can include writing down the principal, reducing the interest rate or extending maturities. Typically, they also involve creditors suffering a loss in net present value. Once restructured, the debt is reclassified as performing and no longer considered to be in default. Official creditors include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, other multilateral development banks, Paris Club creditors, non-Paris Club G20 creditors (notably China, India and South Africa) and other government development agencies. Private creditors are external bondholders, banks and suppliers. The database is posted on the BoC’s website and is updated annually in partnership with the Bank of England (BoE). Regular updates of the BoC–BoE database are useful to researchers analyzing the economic and financial effects of individual sovereign defaults and, importantly, the impacts on global financial stability from episodes involving multiple sovereign defaults. In this paper, we: highlight developments in sovereign debt defaults in 2024, including details on the estimated 10% decrease in the US-dollar value of sovereign debt in default from 2023 update key insights regarding the number, size and types of defaults give a historical overview of debt defaults and their persistence in heavily indebted, low-income sovereigns examine the shift in bilateral official sovereign lending from Paris Club lenders toward China 1 update our estimates of stocks of domestic arrears, valued in US dollars The 2025 edition of the database, as well as related research, contain several enhancements, including: more data about defaults on China’s official loans revisions to country and aggregate default data for 1960 to 2024, which include: new data on domestic arrears by country and globally, most comprehensively for the years 1990 to 2024 updated details about the characteristics of sovereign defaults and sovereign domestic arrears a new illustration ( Figure 1 ) showing debt in default across different regions a new figure showing the proportion of sovereign debt in default and debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) by country updates to documents containing the methodology, appendix and references new data on domestic arrears by country and globally, most comprehensively for the years 1990 to 2024 updated details about the characteristics of sovereign defaults and sovereign domestic arrears a new illustration ( Figure 1 ) showing debt in default across different regions a new figure showing the proportion of sovereign debt in default and debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) by country updates to documents containing the methodology, appendix and references All data are downloadable in CSV, JSON and XML formats. Key insights from the 2025 edition The total value of sovereign debt in default fell by 10% last year Our preliminary estimate of the total value of sovereign debt in default is US$425 billion in 2024, or 0.4% of global public debt. This is a decrease of US$46 billion, or 10%, from the revised total of US$471 billion in 2023. At the same time, we estimate that the number of sovereigns in default declined from 92 to 86, marking the third consecutive decline since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Debt in default fell 37% to US$55 billion for sovereigns that are part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of the IMF and World Bank, and 4% to US$327 billion for emerging- and frontier-market sovereigns. That said, tighter financing conditions continue to impact many heavily indebted low-income sovereigns. By contrast, debt in default among advanced economies remained at zero last year. Defaults to official external creditors rose by 4% in 2024 Loans in default to official creditors increased by US$6.9 billion, or 4%, between 2023 and 2024 to US$177 billion, but each major subgroup of creditors fared differently. For only the third time since 1974, there were no defaults to the IMF. By contrast, defaults to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA)—which form part of the World Bank Group—and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) rose collectively by US$0.3 billion, or 6%, to US$4.8 billion. Among bilateral creditors, identified defaults to China rose by US$17.8 billion, or 49%, to US$54 billion, while defaults to the Paris Club fell by nearly US$10 billion. Defaults to other official creditors that we have not identified separately fell by US$1.4 billion, or 2%, to US$70 billion. Defaults to private external creditors fell by 12% Debt in default to private creditors dropped by US$32 billion, or 12%, to US$243 billion in 2024. As with official creditors, large variations were observed across categories. Defaults on foreign currency bonds, which made up the largest share of defaults ( Chart 1 ), fell by US$32 billion, or 14%. Five sovereigns—El Salvador, Ghana, Mozambique, Niger and Suriname—restructured their debt and were no longer considered to be in default. Of the 11 that remained in default on their foreign currency bonds, the most notable defaults by magnitude were Venezuela (US$53 billion), Russia (US$49 billion), Lebanon (US$43 billion), Ukraine (US$27 billion), Sri Lanka (US$15 billion) and Zambia (US$3 billion). Defaults on bank loans fell by US$2 billion, or 11%, while defaults to other private external creditors (mainly suppliers) rose by US$1.7 billion, or 7%, to US$28 billion. 2 Local currency debt defaults fell sharply by 80% Defaults on local currency debt dropped to US$5.4 billion in 2024 from US$27 billion in 2023, a steep decline of 80%. This is the lowest amount in the last three years and is made up of only two sovereign defaults: Ethiopia’s $5.3 billion local currency default and a small amount of Argentina’s peso debt that has not been restructured. The distribution of defaults remains concentrated As in previous years, the distribution of defaults in 2024 is highly concentrated in terms of value: 13 sovereigns accounted for 90% of the US-dollar value of debt in default globally. Just 4 sovereigns—Venezuela, Russia, Iraq and Lebanon—accounted for 55% of the overall amount in default in 2024. General government debt continues to rise globally with interest rates elevated in many countries The IMF estimates that the global stock of general government debt, measured in US dollars, reached a record US$104 trillion in 2024, or 95% of global GDP. The IMF also projects that the global public debt burden will continue to grow over the medium term, partly due to elevated nominal interest rates and debt service payments. The World Bank notes that interest payments for the 78 countries eligible to borrow from the IDA now average nearly 6% of their total export earnings—the highest level since 1999. 3 Debt service payments for some of these countries run as high as 38% of export earnings.

This increased participation supports the cost-effective distribution of Canada’s debt, but it also represents a potential vulnerability because hedge funds have a greater flight risk than other investor types.","The increasing role of hedge funds in Government of Canada bond auctions Introduction Over the past five years, the volume of Government of Canada (GoC) nominal bonds issued nearly doubled, from $122 billion in 2019–20 to $237 billion in 2024–25 (Bank of Canada 2025a). 1 Despite this, the standard metrics of auction coverage and average yield show that GoC bond auctions have continued to perform well. We demonstrate that, starting in 2020, the increased participation of hedge funds at auctions matches the growth in GoC bond issuance. In fact, hedge funds now represent a significant investor class—the largest class after dealers. We find that hedge funds have responded to the higher dollar amount of GoC bond issuance because of their volume-based business models. This higher hedge fund participation—along with the fact they are more willing than other investor types to pay more for these bonds—explains the increased share of hedge funds’ auction allocation. We explain how hedge funds could be more likely than other types of investors to exit the market suddenly. We also show that their increased participation in auctions could strain the capacity of the balance sheets of dealers’ repurchase agreements (repos). This increased participation supports the cost-effective distribution of Canada’s domestic debt. However, it also represents a vulnerability that is important to acknowledge. Our analysis focuses on core bond tenors: 2, 5, 10 and 30 years. We use proprietary GoC bond auction data from 1999 to 2024 and identify the business type of bidders (including hedge funds) using an internal Bank of Canada list based on market intelligence about bidders’ business models. Hedge fund auction participation has increased Since 2019–20, annual GoC bond issuance has risen considerably across all tenors (Bank of Canada 2025a): 2 from $53 billion to $94 billion in 2-year bonds from $33 billion to $63 billion in 5-year bonds from $13 billion to $63 billion in 10-year bonds from $4 billion to $17 billion in 30-year bonds Chart 1 shows that hedge fund bidding as a share of total auction bidding in each tenor has also grown considerably since 2010, particularly since 2020. Chart 1: Hedge fund bidding as a share of total bidding at Government of Canada bond auctions has grown Hedge funds’ business models can explain why they are the only investor type that increased bidding amid higher debt issuance. Essentially, the broad approach hedge funds take is to: identify a perceived mispricing in the market take a large position on that perceived mispricing—as seen in hedge funds’ substantial use of leverage using repos Hedge funds often use relative value strategies, trading on the perceived mispricing between GoC bonds and either: futures (cash-futures basis trade) swaps (asset swap trade) of a similar term provincial or mortgage bonds denominated in Canadian dollars or other sovereign bonds (cross-market trade) Hedge funds also commonly use strategies based on macroeconomic views (e.g., position on level or shape of the yield curve) or bond pricing at time of auction. Because the GoC bond market is relatively liquid and efficient, smaller mispricing opportunities can mean that hedge funds need to take larger positions to achieve their desired return. In the cash-futures basis trade which involves a long position in a GoC bond and a short position in a GoC futures contract, hedge funds use leverage to amplify their profits as the spread between the two securities is small (Uthemann and Vala 2024). Higher issuance volume makes it easier for hedge funds to take larger long positions. This is because it: increases available bonds to hold for those positions gives the hedge funds a larger base of assets to repo out to fund their positions As well, a larger known future supply event (i.e., auction) for GoC bonds can facilitate larger short positions. 3 That’s because the bigger supply allows hedge funds to obtain the required bonds more easily in the repo market. Further, when the GoC bonds are more liquid, the transaction costs for entering and exiting positions are lower. Accordingly, the rise in GoC bond issuance has coincided with increased hedge fund borrowing against GoC bonds in the repo market to fund their relative value strategies (Bank of Canada 2024). In 2024, the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) persistently rose several basis points above the Bank’s target for the overnight rate. This indicated that hedge funds were holding large, leveraged long bond positions. But the opposite was seen with short positions in 2023 (Plong and Maru 2024a). Regardless of a hedge fund’s specific strategy, the primary market tends to be a cost-effective way to attain these GoC bond positions in large volumes. Purchasing at auction avoids the price impact that can come from buying or selling a large volume of bonds in the secondary market, and auction yields are often slightly higher than prevailing secondary yields. In addition, some strategies (such as auction-based strategies) rely directly on significant primary market participation. Chart 2 shows the strong positive relationship between hedge fund bidding (as a share of total bidding) and total GoC bond stock since 1999. Chart 2: As debt stock rises, participation of hedge funds in bond auctions also increases Note that this same participation incentive from a larger debt stock is likely not as strong for other types of investors, mainly because they have less flexibility and greater difficulty taking on leverage (Sandhu and Vala 2023). Investors other than hedge funds are generally more limited by their cash on hand and tend to use less leverage. 4 Hedge funds have the largest repo positions across asset managers, followed by pension funds (Aldridge, Sandhu and Tchamova 2024). And while dealers can easily access repos and can position for directional views on rates, they are restricted by the balance sheet constraints imposed by internal risk limits and bank regulation. The growing concentration of hedge funds in Government of Canada bond auctions comes with risks Chart 3 shows that the amount of bonds allocated to hedge funds at auctions as a share of total auction allocation has also grown substantially since 2010. It has increased at a faster rate than hedge fund bidding shares because hedge funds tend to bid at more competitive levels than other investor types at auction. 5 Chart 3: Auction allocation to hedge funds has increased from 0% to over 40% in the past 15 years Since 2019–20, key metrics of auction performance—auction coverage ratio 6 and average auction yield—have been mostly stable across all tenors, despite total GoC bond issuance nearly doubling during that time. 7 However, this trend comes with risks. This result follows Arslanalp and Tsuda (2012), who find that foreign non-bank investors—mostly hedge funds in the case of GoC bonds—have a greater flight risk than other types of investors. This greater flight risk is why the increased concentration of hedge funds in sovereign debt markets globally has been seen as contributing to a riskier investor base that compounds the risks from higher general government debt. Canada’s fiscal situation is stronger than the high-risk sovereigns mentioned in Arslanalp and Tsuda (2012), which mitigates potential debt issues. However, this finding suggests that an investor base with a higher concentration of hedge funds nevertheless represents a vulnerability. This flight risk is evident in several ways. Globally, hedge funds have a high failure rate (see, for example Garbaravicius and Dierick 2005). They also face refinancing risks on leverage or margin calls. Finally, most hedge funds that buy GoC bonds are foreign: without organic commitment to the Canadian market, they could be more likely to pull back during a Canada-specific stress event. As noted in the Bank of Canada’s Financial Stability Report—2025 (Bank of Canada 2025b), the increasing role of hedge funds extends to the secondary market, which also comes with both benefits and risks. Sandhu and Vala (2023) find that hedge fund trading can promote two-sided GoC markets in normal times, but during the stress period of the COVID-19 pandemic it amplified one-sided GoC selling, which contributed to market illiquidity. The rising activity of hedge funds in the GoC primary and secondary market could place additional pressure on the total GoC fixed-income infrastructure. Namely, hedge funds’ positioning, both long and short, in the bond market is ultimately financed through the repo market. The aggregate balance sheet for repo books across dealers is finite and driven by several factors (e.g., number of dealers, regulation, central clearing infrastructure). Such pressure points have been reflected in elevated CORRA levels (Plong and Maru 2024b). Therefore, this trend of increased hedge fund participation raises questions of capacity for the repo market. A strain in this repo capacity could also be another source of hedge fund flight risk. Conclusion Canada’s recent rising debt environment has incentivized more hedge fund participation in the GoC market, due to their volume- and leverage-based business models. As a result, hedge funds have taken an increased role in absorbing new GoC bond issuance. This has been beneficial for the Government of Canada because it has supported the continued strong performance of GoC bond auctions and has contributed to greater secondary market trading, which bolsters liquidity. However, this increased hedge fund presence also comes with rising risks of potentially significant investor outflow, given hedge funds’ business models, lack of natural anchor to the GoC bond market and dependence on the repo market to obtain leverage. We hope to increase awareness of these risks with this staff analytical note. References Aldridge, P., J. Sandhu and S.

An updated analysis,https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/07/staff-analytical-note-2025-21/,We update an assessment of potential changes in payments that mortgage holders could face at renewal in 2025 and 2026. We use an enhanced dataset (RESL2) that provides a more accurate starting point for mortgage balances.,"How will mortgage payments change at renewal? An updated analysis Introduction About 60% of all outstanding mortgages in Canada are expected to renew in 2025 or 2026. In this note, we provide an updated assessment of how mortgage payments may change for these households at renewal. To do so, we use an enhanced dataset on the stock of real estate secured lending. We make two assumptions in our assessment: Interest rates evolve in line with financial market expectations. At renewal, all borrowers renew into the same type of mortgage they already had for the same term. Based on those assumptions, we find the following: About 60% of mortgage holders renewing in 2025 and 2026 are expected to see a payment increase. Most of these borrowers hold a five-year, fixed-rate mortgage. Compared with December 2024 payments, the average monthly mortgage payment could be 10% higher for those renewing in 2025 and 6% higher for those renewing in 2026. These overall numbers, however, hide large differences between borrowers and between types of products. For instance, mortgage holders with a five-year, fixed rate contract renewing in 2025 or 2026 could face an average payment increase of around 15%–20% compared with their payment in December 2024. Those with variable rates and variable payments could see an average payment decline of around 5%–7%. The dataset The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada’s federal banking regulator, collects monthly data on the existing stock of mortgages held by federally regulated financial institutions. Previously, Bank staff used an earlier version of this dataset, called RESL1, to simulate changes in mortgage payments. RESL1 captured mortgages only at origination and renewal. 1 The enhanced dataset, called RESL2, provides a snapshot of every outstanding residential mortgage each month. Since May 2023, the data in RESL2 include the latest revisions and improved definitions and coverage. 2 Relative to RESL1, the enhanced dataset gives a more updated reading of the stock of mortgages at the start of the simulation period. This is because RESL2 provides up-to-date outstanding balances that account for prepayments since last renewal or origination. Methodology Our work uses the methodology described in teNyenhuis and Su (2023) to assess changes in mortgage payments. The authors assumed each mortgage holder renewed into the same mortgage product, meaning a borrower with a variable-rate mortgage would renew with a variable-rate mortgage that had the same term length and remaining amortization. We construct the interest rate path by combining historical mortgage rates and market expectations for both the policy interest rate and rates for government bonds ( Chart 1 ). The spread on each mortgage is assumed to stay constant over time. 3 Chart 1: Financial market participants expect interest rates to remain largely stable to 2027 For the simulation period, we assume borrowers make scheduled payments only. In other words, they do not make extra lump-sum payments, nor do they increase their regular payments to reduce their balance faster than scheduled. However, if they accelerated their payment schedule since last renewal or origination, the simulation would start with the accelerated schedule—which was not possible in the previous version of the simulation. The results Even with recent declines in interest rates, about 60% of mortgage holders renewing in 2025 and 2026 will likely see their payments increase from December 2024 levels. Around 75% of those facing payment increases hold a five-year, fixed-rate mortgage ( Chart 2 , panel b). Mortgage holders facing an increase represent about one-third of all mortgage holders in Canada ( Chart 2 , panel a). On the flip side, close to one-quarter of all mortgage holders are expected to see a decrease in payments by the end of 2026. Most of these mortgage holders have a short-term, fixed-rate mortgage. Chart 2: About one-third of all mortgage holders are likely to see payment increases by the end of 2026 Chart 2: About one-third of all mortgage holders are likely to see payment increases by the end of 2026 a. Distribution of outstanding mortgages in Canada, based on what will happen to their payments between December 2024 and... b. Distribution of outstanding mortgages that will see an increase or decrease by the end of 2026 Sources: Regulatory filings of Canadian banks and Bank of Canada calculations Five-year, fixed-rate mortgages make up around 40% of all mortgages in Canada. Holders of these mortgages renewing in 2026 are likely to see an average increase in payments of 20% ( Chart 3 ). This group is expected to face the largest average payment increases among mortgage holders renewing in 2026. At the other end, payments for variable-rate, variable-payment mortgages have passed their peak. Based on market expectations for interest rates, these payments should continue to decline. For variable-rate, fixed-payment mortgages, the range of payment changes is wide: At the top of the range, 10% of borrowers renewing in 2026 will see an increase of more than 40%. At the bottom of the range, a quarter of borrowers renewing in 2026 will see a decrease of at least 7%. This wide range mainly reflects the principal payments some borrowers have made since origination or the previous renewal. Some borrowers have increased their monthly payment to make sure it continues covering the interest and principal. 4 These borrowers will face smaller payment increases at renewal than borrowers who are in negative amortization, where the monthly payment does not fully cover the interest, which is then added to the principal. Chart 3: Change in monthly payments at renewal depends on the type of mortgage Borrowers with variable-rate, fixed-payment mortgages who originated or last renewed before March 2022—when the Bank began raising rates—have, on average, repaid three times the required amount of principal. This is because about 80% of these borrowers have repaid more than what their contract required. As a result, only about 5% of all borrowers who originated or last renewed a variable-rate, fixed-payment mortgage before 2022 had a higher principal balance in February 2025 than at origination or the previous renewal. This is a much smaller share than the 25% of borrowers we would have expected to be in this position based on the contract information ( Chart 4 ). Chart 4: Borrowers with variable-rate, fixed-payment mortgages have repaid more principal than expected Borrowers facing a payment increase will see a larger change in their mortgage debt service (MDS) ratio than those with payment decreases. 5 For mortgage holders facing a payment decrease, the median MDS ratio will drop 1.1 percentage points from 19.7% at the end of 2024 to 18.6% by the end of 2026. For borrowers facing a payment increase, the median MDS ratio will rise by 2.7 percentage points from 15.3% in December 2024 to 18.0% by the end of 2026. These expected changes in the MDS ratio assume that borrowers’ incomes have not changed since origination or the previous renewal. However, many mortgage holders facing payment increases in 2025 and 2026 will likely have seen their incomes rise since they originated or renewed their mortgage. These increases in income should help borrowers manage higher payments. Most borrowers also have other options for managing higher payments: Some can extend the amortization on their mortgage. This would be available to many borrowers with a five-year term. The results of the simulation suggest that about half of the borrowers facing higher payments could eliminate increases by extending amortization by five years. Some can extract equity from their home as a short-term solution. Many households have repaid a significant amount of the mortgage principal over the years and thus could access more borrowing room from home equity lines of credit if they require additional cash to make payments. Additionally, most borrowers are expected to face interest rates below what they were stress-tested for, based on the path markets expect for rates. These borrowers qualified for their mortgages after being stress-tested at an interest rate that was at least 200 basis points higher than their contract rate. Conclusion We use an enhanced dataset of outstanding mortgages, known as RESL2, to provide an updated assessment of potential changes to mortgage payments. RESL2 allows us to better capture the effect of prepayments on future increases in mortgage payments. Overall, we do not expect upcoming mortgage renewals will lead to a severe worsening of financial stress for affected borrowers, holding everything else constant. 6 Indeed, most borrowers will likely have higher income at renewal and should face interest rates below what they were stress-tested for. That said, some borrowers with higher payments at renewal will face challenges. Many of them will need to change their spending to manage higher mortgage payments. And some may struggle to meet their other financial obligations. References Al Aboud, O., S. Sheikh, A. Su and Y.

Our estimates suggest a sale of 1% of the available supply of bonds typically lowers bond prices by 0.2%. From 2000 to 2025, demand from institutional investors, such as Canadian pension funds and foreign investors, explains 69% of quarterly price variation, with the remainder explained by changes in the supply of bonds.","The impact of trading flows on Government of Canada bond prices Introduction If a market participant, say a hedge fund, were to sell 1% of the total available supply of Government of Canada (GoC) bonds—worth about $11 billion as of December 2024—how much would GoC bond prices drop? Our analysis suggests they could drop by an average of 0.2% over one quarter, which translates to a 2–basis point rise in the yield for 10-year GoC bonds. Market participants and policy-makers alike need to understand how trading flows—both sales and purchases—affect GoC bond prices. Such insights help make clear how large flows can move markets and how participants within the financial system might behave during periods of stress. For the Bank of Canada (the Bank), this knowledge is particularly useful to: assess the market impact of its policy actions understand how institutional investors’ trading affects market stability monitor potential vulnerabilities in the financial system We base our analysis on a basic insight about how prices respond to flows in bond markets. When investors want to sell bonds, prices must decline to attract other investors to purchase them. This price impact crucially depends on how willing other investors are to absorb these bond flows. This willingness can be measured by the concept of price elasticity of demand. Our estimates indicate that, at an individual investor level, if GoC bond prices decrease by 1%, investors would prefer to increase their GoC bond holdings by 3%, all else being equal. This elasticity represents adjustments toward or away from GoC bonds that investors would like to make to their portfolios in response to price changes. Of course, if the total supply of bonds remains fixed, prices must adjust sufficiently to induce some investors to hold the available supply. Our analysis suggests that quarterly fluctuations in GoC bond prices are driven primarily by changes in demand from large institutional investors, such as foreign investors and Canadian pension funds. Over the period from 2000 to 2025, on average, 69% of the quarterly fluctuation in GoC bond prices can be attributed to demand-side investors. The supply side—new GoC bond issuances minus the Bank’s purchases of GoC bonds—accounts for the remaining 31% of quarterly price movements in the GoC bond market. Key market players and their impact On the demand side, the GoC bond market is dominated by a few large institutional investors with distinct investment strategies: non-residents, such as foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds and foreign hedge funds Canadian trusteed pension funds Canadian chartered banks other institutional investors, such as mutual funds and insurers As of early 2025, non-residents and Canadian pension funds together held 62% of publicly available GoC bonds. Canadian mutual funds, insurers and banks held another 20% ( Chart 1 ). Chart 1: Non-residents and Canadian pension funds hold more than half the share of Government of Canada bonds in the market To isolate the impact of flows on prices, we need to separate investor-specific trading decisions from flows that are motivated by changes in economic conditions or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy. We do this by: identifying GoC bond flows that are unique to specific investor groups measuring how an aggregate of these investor-specific flows affects GoC bond prices controlling for common factors that influence all investors simultaneously This approach is based on Gabaix and Koijen (2024) and relies on investor-specific flows that are large enough to affect bond prices. The resulting price moves can then be used to estimate the price elasticities of private institutional investors (demand side), who must absorb shifts in the supply of GoC bonds issued by the Canadian government. 1 We estimate a common price elasticity for the demand side (see Table B‑1 in Appendix B ). While a pension fund may respond differently to prices than a mutual fund would, having a single elasticity across all private investors captures their average price sensitivity as a group. 2 Conceptually, our estimated elasticities reflect the idea that GoC bond prices can adjust for several reasons: When changes in the aggregate demand for GoC bonds are balanced with changes in their supply—If the government raises the total available supply by issuing new bonds, prices adjust to incentivize investors to increase their GoC bond holdings. When the total available supply remains unchanged—This occurs if one investor simply wants to sell a GoC bond; another investor needs to be incentivized to buy it. GoC bond prices adjust to support this reallocation. When there are no observable trading flows—For example, if weaker-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) data lead all investors to increase their demand for GoC bonds, prices may rise even if no immediate trading occurs. In this case, all investors’ collective willingness to hold GoC bonds increases, resulting in a higher price. 3 Specifically, our estimates suggest that, if the typical market participant sells 1% of the amount outstanding of GoC bonds for reasons unrelated to the macroeconomy and monetary or fiscal policy, GoC bond prices decline by 0.2% over a quarter, which translates to a 2–basis point rise in the yield for 10-year GoC bonds ( Chart 2) . Take the real-world example of the COVID-19 crisis in the first quarter of 2020. Our model shows the Bank’s purchase of $19 billion in GoC bonds would have caused GoC bond prices to rise by an estimated 1.1%, which translates to an 11–basis point decline in the 10-year yield. Our model's predictions are broadly aligned with previous research findings based on alternative methodologies (Arora et al. 2021; Diez de los Rios 2024; Azizova, Witmer and Zhang 2024). 4 , 5 Chart 2: Estimated impact of trading flows on the Government of Canada bond market What drives Government of Canada bond prices? Our model attributes quarterly GoC bond price movements to three distinct drivers: Investor-specific factors —Each investor group responds to factors specific to their own circumstances, such as changes in their investment mandates. Common factors that influence all investors —Investors react to common economic factors, such as growth in GDP. However, different investor groups may respond with varying intensity. Size of investors’ GoC bond holdings —The influence of investor-specific and common factors on prices depends on the size of the investor group: larger investors have a greater impact on prices when they trade simply because their trades are bigger in absolute terms. By examining these three drivers together, we can measure how much they contribute to the overall quarterly price movements in the GoC bond market. 6 The clear pattern from our analysis is the importance of investor-specific factors in driving quarterly GoC bond prices ( Chart 3 ). Bond supply changes account for 31% of quarterly price fluctuations. Almost all of this variation reflects unique factors specific to the government’s funding needs. For the demand side, large institutional investors make up another 39%, with demand from non-residents being responsible for 24% and demand from Canadian pension funds for 15% of the overall quarterly price fluctuation. Within the model we use, these numbers reflect how prices must adjust to induce other investors and the supply side to accommodate changes in GoC bond holdings of a given investor group. Chart 3: Quarterly fluctuations in Government of Canada bond prices are mainly driven by investor-specific factors Important considerations Although our analysis provides valuable insights, several factors that are not explicitly considered here can influence the actual price impact of trading flows: Market conditions—Heightened uncertainty in stressed markets can make market participants less willing to take on risk. Investors may need larger price adjustments in stressed markets than in normal market conditions to compensate for the additional volatility. Bond maturity—Long-term bonds carry more interest rate risk than short-term bonds, reflecting the greater uncertainty about future interest rates over longer time horizons. Investors may require larger price adjustments to accommodate the flows of long-term bonds. Persistence of flows—Flows that revert quickly have lower price impacts than permanent shifts in bond holdings do. Market participants are therefore more willing to accommodate temporary imbalances, knowing they will soon reverse. Conclusion Understanding how flows affect GoC bond prices helps the Bank of Canada monitor and assess: financing conditions for the government the transmission of monetary policy stability risks of large asset sales by the private sector We find that large flows can impact GoC bond prices significantly, even in normal market conditions. The size of this impact depends on market participants’ willingness to accommodate the corresponding flows, as measured by their price elasticities. Appendix A: Estimating the demand system for Government of Canada bonds We base our estimates on the methodologies of Gabaix and Koijen (2021; 2024). The demand and supply of bonds We model the quarterly percentage change of sector \(\displaystyle i\)’s Government of Canada (GoC) bond holdings as \(\displaystyle\, \Delta q_{it}\) \(\displaystyle=\, \alpha_i\) \(\displaystyle-\, ζ^d \, \Delta p_t\) \(\displaystyle+\, λ_{i}^{'} \, η_t \) \(\displaystyle+\, u_{it} \) \(\displaystyle,\) where \( \Delta q_{it}\) \(=\, \frac{Q_{it}-{Q_{it-1}}} {Q_{it-1}} ,\) \( ζ^d \) is the demand elasticity, \( \Delta p_t\) is the log change of GoC bond price, \( η_t \) is a vector of common shocks, \( λ_{i}^{'} \) is a vector of factor loadings and \( u_{it} \) is an idiosyncratic shock. Similarly, we model the quarterly change in the supply of GoC bonds to the private sector, that is, net of government holdings, as \(\displaystyle\, \Delta S_{t}\) \(\displaystyle=\, \alpha^s\) \(\displaystyle+\, ζ^s \, \Delta p_t\) \(\displaystyle+\, \phi^{'} \, η_t \) \(\displaystyle+\, \epsilon_{t} \) \(\displaystyle,\) where \( ζ^s \) is the supply elasticity, \( \phi^{'} \) is a vector of the supply sector’s factor loading and \( \epsilon_{t} \) is an idiosyncratic supply shock. The GoC bond price must adjust to make sure that the aggregate change in investor demand for GoC bonds is equal to the change in the supply of bonds to the private sector. Let \( w_{it-1}\) \(=\, \frac{Q_{it-1}} {\sum_{i} Q_{it-1}} \) denote sector \(\displaystyle i\)’s holding share of GoC bonds. Given the above expressions for demand and supply, market clearing imposes that \( \Delta S_{t}\) \(=\, \sum_{i} \Delta q_{it}\). This implies that \(\displaystyle\, \Delta p_{t}\) \(\displaystyle=\, \left(\frac{1} {ζ^d + ζ^s}\right)\) \((\sum_{i} w_{it-1} \alpha_{i} \) \(\displaystyle+\, u ̌_t\) \(+\, (λ^{ ̌ ' }-ϕ^{'} ) η_t\) \(\displaystyle-\, \alpha^{s} \) \(\displaystyle-\, \epsilon_{t} ) \) \(\displaystyle,\) where \( u ̌_t\) \(=\sum_{i} w_{it-1} u_{it} \) and \( λ^{ ̌ ' } = \sum_{i} w_{it-1} λ^{'}_i \). Granular instrumental variables We follow Gabaix and Koijen (2021) and construct the granular instrumental variable (GIV). First, we obtain quarterly changes in GoC bond holdings for different sectors \( i\) from Statistics Canada’s National Balance Sheet Accounts and Financial Flow Accounts. Then we obtain the residuals, \( \Delta q ̌_{it}\), of a weighted regression of \( \Delta q_{it}\): \( \Delta q_{it}\) \(=\alpha_{i} \) \(+ \alpha_{t} \) \(+ λ^{'}_i \,GDP\,growth_{t} \) \(+ \delta_{i} t \) \(+ \Delta q ̌_{it}\) \(,\) where \(GDP\,growth\) is quarterly real gross domestic product growth, and a proxy for common shock, \(\delta_{i} t\), allows for a different time trend. Some sectors grow faster than others, and the weights are equal to the standard deviation of \( \Delta q_{it}\). 7 We extract the principal components of \(E_{i}^{\frac{1} {2}} \Delta q ̌_{it}\) and denote the estimated vector of those components by \(η_t\). We construct the GIV instrument as \(GIV = \sum_{i} w_{it-1} \Delta q ̌_{it} \) and use it to estimate both demand elasticity, \(ζ^{d}\), and supply elasticity, \(ζ^{s}\). Appendix B: Price elasticity estimates for the demand and supply sides Table B-1 reports the estimated average sensitivity of quarterly changes in investor holdings of Government of Canada (GoC) bonds to quarterly returns of the GoC bond market. This estimate is based on the model described in Appendix A . Estimates are calculated over the sample period, from the second quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2025. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Under our consolidated government perspective, changes in the supply of GoC bonds are the result of new bond issuance by the Government of Canada, net of maturing bonds and bond purchases by the Bank of Canada. Bond sales by the Bank would increase the supply. The Bank’s bond market activities include, for example, both deliberate policy measures, such as quantitative easing, and routine operations to manage its balance sheet. See “ About the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet ” for more details.[ ← ] 2. We allow our consolidated Canadian government grouping (the GoC and the Bank) to be reactive to GoC bond prices to better capture how supply-side factors interact with market conditions over time. We find the supply elasticity is substantially smaller than the demand elasticity. And if we remove the 2008–09 global financial crisis period, when issuance expanded while interest rates fell, then the supply elasticity would be statistically indistinguishable from 0. If we assume a supply elasticity of 0, meaning the consolidated government is completely unresponsive to prices, then our main conclusions are unchanged.[ ← ] 3. Our model captures shifts in macroeconomic expectations (e.g., GDP) through common factors, which influence all investors’ demand simultaneously. See Appendix A for more details.[ ← ] 4. A 1% sale of the available supply of GoC bonds impacts the value of the GoC bond market. This impact is the inverse of the sum of demand and supply elasticities: -0.2% = 1/(3.26 + 1.34)*(-1). This -0.2% return is converted into the approximate change in the 10-year GoC zero-coupon bond yield by dividing by the bond’s duration and multiplying by 100 to change from percent to basis points: (-0.2%/-10)*100 = 2 basis points.[ ← ] 5. Our model focuses on the portfolio channel of the Bank’s quantity-based policies and does not model any impact these policies may have by the Bank signalling a change of its policy stance to the market.[ ← ] 6.

Central to these debates is the question of how many electronic funds transfer (EFT) systems can viably coexist within a jurisdiction while achieving scale economies to ensure that average cost is minimized, a threshold that largely depends on the shape of the cost function. In this paper, we conduct a cross-country meta-analysis using data from 13 social cost studies across 9 jurisdictions between 2001 and 2016. We quantitatively estimate a cost function relating the total transaction volume to the per-transaction cost and interpret its parameters in terms of fixed and variable costs. We find a rapidly decreasing, convex cost curve that plateaus quickly at around one billion annual transactions. Additionally, we estimate the marginal cost of an EFT to be approximately $0.55 per transaction, expressed in 2025 Canadian dollars, and the total fixed cost to be approximately $83 million per year.

Evidence from the Business Leaders’ Pulse This paper replicates and extends the work of Altig et al. (2022) on firms’ subjective sales growth expectations using Canadian survey data from the Bank of Canada’s Business Leaders’ Pulse. We examine the formation, uncertainty and predictive validity of firm-level sales growth forecasts using subjective probability distributions from business leaders at a one-year-ahead horizon. The replication work performed here confirms several findings from Altig et al. (2022), including that expected sales growth predicts realized sales growth, subjective uncertainty predicts forecast errors and firms frequently revise their expectations, usually by small amounts. We also find that subjective uncertainty predicts the magnitude of forecast revisions and follows a V-shaped relationship with past sales growth. We extend the original analysis by further demonstrating that firms with weaker recent performance assign greater weight to future weak growth scenarios, and subsequently that these firms are more likely to underperform, suggesting expectations are grounded in real conditions. The results presented in this paper reinforce the value of firm-level survey data for macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis and help validate the Business Leaders’ Pulse as a reliable source of firm-level expectations data.

The latter arise from imperfect substitutability between stocks and short- and long-term government bonds in mutual funds’ portfolios. Since households’ consumption-savings decisions are tied to expected portfolio returns, the required returns on all three assets affect overall demand in the economy. The model shows that the central bank’s equity purchases would lower the risk and term premiums on stocks and long-term bonds, respectively, and thereby stimulate economic activity. Since stocks comprise a larger share in asset portfolios and are less substitutable for short-term securities than long-term bonds are, the effects of stock purchases on aggregate demand are larger than those of similar-sized bond purchases.

Changes in asset supply or the transaction cost of a single safe asset affect aggregate liquidity and the returns of all assets.

Specifically, the elasticity of substitution between goods declines during periods of strong per-capita consumption and vice versa, giving firms an incentive to adjust their desired markup in response to the state of demand. Empirical evidence favouring a direct role for per-capita consumption demand in inflation determination for Canada is presented.","Non-homothetic Preferences and the Demand Channel of Inflation The post-pandemic rise in global inflation has renewed interest in the relative roles played by demand and supply factors in determining prices. Many central banks have stressed the joint role that persistent increases in input costs and excess demand played in boosting inflation in 2021 and 2022. Yet the latter influence plays no independent role in the workhorse New Keynesian models used by many central banks. Under the typical assumption of constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences, variations in consumption shift the firm’s profit function up and down, but do not influence its curvature. As a result, the optimal markup is not a function of demand. This assumption is contradicted by both evidence about household shopping behaviour and survey evidence about how firms set prices. This paper proposes an alternative structure based on non-homothetic household preferences over varieties of consumption goods. Specifically, the elasticity of substitution between goods is state dependent, declining during periods of strong per-capita consumption and vice versa. This captures the stylized fact that individual consumers are less price sensitive during economic booms and more price sensitive during downturns. These substitution effects in turn give the firm an incentive to adjust its markup in response to consumption demand. In aggregate, this generates desired markups that increase nonlinearly in consumption demand. When strategic complementarities in pricing are present, these preferences also give rise to state-dependent pass-through of cost shocks. A New Keynesian sticky price model featuring non-homothetic preferences is estimated on Canadian data, and strong evidence favouring a direct role for per-capita consumption demand is presented. This model is better able to capture the increase in core inflation that occurred in 2021–22, particularly when simulated in its nonlinear form.

We rely on a combination of sign, zero and elasticity restrictions to identify structural shocks. The foreign block (global and US variables) impacts the domestic block (a large number of Canadian macrofinancial variables), but not vice-versa. Simulations suggest that tighter financial conditions in the United States can spill over to Canada, and a regime change in macrofinancial elasticities provides a good replication of economic downturns. The RAMM can be used to assess the financial stability implications of both domestic and foreign-originated risk scenarios. DOI: https://doi.org/10.34989/tr-123",html,2026-01-07 09:34:09,,,,,

Data from Canada’s fixed-income settlement authority, the Canadian Depository for Securities (CDS), is a valuable source of historical information on Canada’s fixed-income markets, especially from 2003 to 2016 when few other data sources were available. However, the CDS does not contain details on the terms of trade for repos, such as the repo rate, term or haircut. In the data, each repo is recorded as two distinct settlements but, critically, the sale and repurchase legs of a repo are not explicitly associated. We use a variant of the Gale-Shapley algorithm to solve a “stable roommates” problem to link repos’ sale and repurchase transactions and compute their terms of trade. We verify our algorithm by running it on a separate dataset that explicitly associates the sale and repurchase legs of a repo. In addition, we verify the computed repo terms of trade by comparing a subsample of the CDS data with a third dataset that reports terms of trade directly. The derived data are useful for researchers to study the evolution of fixed-income market structure and market conditions. DOI: https://doi.org/10.34989/tr-121",html,2026-01-07 09:34:09,,,,,

To support the broader financial-sector community in building these capabilities, this report provides detail on the methodologies the pilot used to assess credit and market risks, which were informed by the financial impacts generated by the climate transition scenarios. The method to assess credit risk combined top-down and bottom-up approaches. Variables from the climate transition scenarios were first translated into sector-level financial impacts. The financial institutions then used these impacts to estimate the implications on credit outcomes through borrower-level assessments. Using the transition scenarios’ financial impacts, and the stressed credit outcomes, the project estimated a relationship between climate transition information and credit risk. This was used to calculate expected credit losses at the portfolio level. The method to assess market risk was solely top-down. Using the scenario analysis, the project used a dividend discount model to estimate sectoral equity revaluations, which it then applied to equity portfolio holdings.

Understanding the macroeconomic and financial system impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy is therefore a priority for the Bank. Below, we outline key economic questions on this topic, some of which will form the basis of the Bank’s medium-term climate change research agenda. Climate change looms as a potentially large structural change affecting the economy and the financial system. This is in the context of scientific estimates that, through the emission of greenhouse gases, human activities have caused approximately 1.0 degree Celsius of global warming above pre-industrial levels and, if it continues to increase at the current rate, global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 (IPCC 2018). In the absence of mitigation policies, current quantitative estimates for physical effects on the macroeconomy between now and the end of the century indicate a risk of potentially large negative effects, ranging from 1.5 to 23 percent of global annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. 1 The effects of widespread warming, including more frequent and severe extreme weather events, are projected to intensify. These climate changes pose physical risks to Canadians and the Canadian economy. The 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by 195 countries, established a goal of holding the increase in global temperature within a range of 1.5 to 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as well as a commitment to engage in adaptation planning and implementation. Achieving this goal implies a timely transition to a low-carbon economy. Such a transition involves implementing a range of climate policies, making significant technological progress, investing in green technologies and inducing major socio-economic changes. 2 While this transition creates opportunities for innovation, investment and potential green growth, it also poses economic transition risks . Changes in climate policies, technology or market sentiment could lead to economic dislocation and a reassessment of the value of a variety of financial assets. In particular, climate change–driven alteration of projected earnings and expenses could affect the debt repayment capacity and collateral of borrowers and increase credit risk borne by banks and other financial institutions. The speed at which such asset repricing would occur is uncertain, but its impacts could be important for the safety and soundness of financial institutions and financial stability. Maintaining the warming below 2.0 degrees Celsius implies that some of the existing fossil fuel reserves will become stranded assets , i.e., unusable, in the absence of potential cost-effective technologies for carbon dioxide capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal. 3 The assets that could be affected are not limited to the oil and gas sector; they include other carbon-intensive sectors such as transportation (including aviation and shipping), real estate, electricity generation (e.g., coal plants), heavy industry and agriculture. These transition risks are of particular significance for Canada given its endowment of carbon-intensive commodities, the current importance of some of these carbon-intensive sectors for the Canadian economy, and the energy needs for cooling and heating. Below, we describe the main issues, outstanding research questions and some promising directions of research along two main themes: macroeconomic forecasting and monetary policy, and financial system risk assessment and stability. Macroeconomic forecasting and monetary policy The objective of monetary policy is to preserve the value of money by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. To maintain a stable price environment over the medium term, monetary policy relies on identifying the nature, persistence and magnitude of the shocks affecting the economy as well as on the forecast of potential output and, therefore, the output gap and inflationary pressures. The physical risks of climate change will likely imply increases in the frequency and severity of negative supply shocks (e.g., destruction of capital stocks, disruptions to labour supply, disruptions to supply chains) and demand shocks (e.g., damage to household and corporate balance sheets that result in reduced consumption and investment). While demand shocks are typically manageable from a monetary policy perspective, supply shocks are generally more challenging because they generate a trade-off for central banks between stabilizing inflation and stabilizing output fluctuations. A rise in the frequency and severity of negative supply shocks makes it more difficult for central banks to accurately forecast output gaps and, by extension, inflation. In particular, changes in weather patterns could lead to increased volatility of headline inflation (e.g., food prices) and, in some circumstances, could affect inflation expectations. 4 The associated increase in the volatility of inflation and output could also have important implications for the choice of monetary policy regime (e.g., inflation targeting, price-level targeting or nominal income/GDP targeting) because they differ in their balance of output and inflation goals and their ability to tie down inflationary expectations. Along the transition to a low-carbon economy, as relative prices adjust, there will likely be significant economic dislocation as the economy goes through a period of restructuring and adaptation. Clear, timely and gradual climate policies, accompanied by policies that support the structural reform of the economy (e.g., that make labour markets more adaptable and responsive, promote innovation and improve the business environment), can mitigate the negative impacts of the transition. Changes in the global demand for fossil fuels, as well as carbon pricing policies and technological innovation, could lead to long-term movements in oil and gas prices and in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar and other currencies. In turn, this could affect inflation (through import prices and changes in the demand for exports) and medium-term inflation expectations. Gradual global warming and the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the uncertainty associated with their paths and effects, also pose significant challenges to the forecast of potential output and long-run economic growth. The rise of global temperatures and adaptation to it could have important impacts on labour and total factor productivity. Equally, migration, disruption and conflict resulting from climate change could affect both social and organizational capital and the productive capacity of the economy. There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future path of climate change, climate policies, technological innovation and socio-economic changes. Climate-economy models must therefore be used to develop a range of plausible macrofinancial scenarios to assess possible outcomes. The Bank of Canada, as a member of the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), has been working with regulators and other central banks to develop common macrofinancial scenarios as a reference point. Below, we describe the main research questions, and briefly discuss some useful approaches and methodologies to address them, along core areas of economic interest to the Bank: impacts of more frequent and severe extreme weather events on short-term macroeconomic forecasting and inflation, sectoral, regional and macroeconomic effects of the transition to a low-carbon economy, and long-term structural effects of global warming. Impacts of more frequent and severe extreme weather events on short-term macroeconomic forecasting and inflation Over the past 40 years there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events around the world. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, insurers in Canada have also reported larger catastrophic weather events per year across the country since 1983, including a big jump in the number of events since 2011. The extent to which price dynamics and the output gap are affected by these events will be determined by how they affect the balance of demand and supply within the economy and how persistent these effects are. A short-term research priority for the Bank is to leverage weather data, spatial analysis and data science to improve the forecast accuracy of our policy models. Using weather data, we plan to examine the effect of weather events on key Canadian macroeconomic variables such as growth and inflation. Some of the effects might be predictable and could be incorporated in the Bank’s forecasting models, while others might be less predictable, giving rise to economic shocks. Empirical work and case studies on specific regions and sectors can also be useful to quantify near-term weather effects related to climate and inform the choice of model inputs, including the correlation and variance/co-variance structure of the shocks affecting the economy. In the longer term the Bank might also consider incorporating climate-related shocks and policies explicitly into our monetary policy models, including natural disasters, labour supply effects, and disruptions to supply chains and international trade. Despite a few exceptions, dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium (DSGE) models, often used by central banks in macroeconomic and monetary policy analysis, normally abstract from climate change and related policies. These models could be augmented to account for these elements. Similarly, semi-structural macro-modelling approaches could be augmented with climate-related natural disasters. Finally, the planned comparison of monetary policy rules for the review of the inflation-control target should allow us to shed light on the efficacy of different rules in the face of more frequent and severe supply shocks. 5 Sectoral, regional and macroeconomic effects of the transition to a low-carbon economy The oil and gas sector and other carbon-intensive sectors are important to the current structure of the Canadian economy. Changes in preferences, technology and policies along the transition path, including climate policy, are expected to lead to significant changes in relative prices. These price changes could lead to the reallocation of resources across sectors and alteration in cross-country comparative advantages, patterns of trade and specialization, balance of payments and exchange rates. When applied regionally, the economic impact of climate policies depends strongly on interactions with other regions in the world. Lasting shifts in the energy mix are also expected to persistently change energy prices, which could feed into inflation expectations and wages, creating inflationary pressures. 6 To fully understand the regional and sectoral impacts of the transition to a low-carbon economy, multi-regional and multi-sectoral dynamic general-equilibrium models will be used by the Bank in combination with different transition scenarios. Computational general-equilibrium (CGE) models based on national accounts and international trade flows at the sectoral level are traditionally well-suited to this type of analysis and can account for potential border carbon adjustments and carbon leakage effects. 7 The Bank has recently brought in a climate-economy CGE model to explore the sectoral and macroeconomic implications of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including the implications for inflation and stranded assets. Preliminary work identifies several channels of transition risks to the global and Canadian economies. On the empirical side, trade data at the sectoral level can be used to analyze the structural response of the economy to changes in climate policies. In the medium term, the Bank can also explore case studies of historical oil price shocks and their origin (demand versus supply) to inform the analysis of the macroeconomic impacts. Long-term structural effects of global warming Long-term modelling of potential productive capacity and economic growth is essential for monetary policy. To that end, it is important to capture the impact of global warming and the transition to a low-carbon economy on physical, natural and human capital stock, labour supply and productivity. The Bank has begun to assess the channels through which climate change could impact Canadian and global potential output and the neutral rate of interest. In the medium term, the Bank will seek to devote some research to modelling how global warming affects total factor productivity (TFP) through diverting resources to adapting and rebuilding physical capital and to climate-related migration. Assessing the long-term macroeconomic consequences of climate change has mostly relied on integrated assessment models (IAMs) that seek to capture the complex interactions between the physical and economic dimensions of climate change, including endogenous feedback loops between temperature and GDP. 8 Many IAMs are being used by intergovernmental organizations and national governments to support the development of climate policy. However, these models are still evolving, and several criticisms have been raised, including: They rely on damage functions to capture the effects of climate change on the level of GDP. 9 They ignore the endogenous dynamic effects through which climate change potentially affects economic growth. They ignore uncertainty regarding the increase in temperature and the non-linear impacts of climate change. They ignore the distributional consequences of climate change. 10 To address some of these criticisms, IAMs that account for endogenous growth effects of climate change can be developed. 11 These models could also consider the effects of green growth associated with structural reforms related to climate change and incorporate uncertainty (e.g., DSGE models) and imperfect foresight directly. 12 For tractability, IAMs also rely on the representative agent assumption, making these models poorly suited for analyzing the distributional consequences of climate change. Heterogeneous agent DSGE models and agent-based models might be better alternatives for such analysis. The Bank will collaborate with the academic community and other central banks to enhance the climate-economy modelling tool kit. Assessing climate-related risks to the financial system More frequent or severe extreme weather events and/or a late and abrupt transition to a low-carbon economy could have significant impacts on the Canadian financial system, with potential systemic consequences. Extreme weather events could cause damage to physical assets, including real estate, capital and infrastructure, and loss of life with consequent property and casualty (P&C) insurance losses, damage to balance sheets of both households and firms, increases in defaults, and potential financial sector distress. A late and abrupt transition to a low-carbon economy could lead to a sudden repricing of climate-related risks and stranded assets, which could negatively affect the balance sheets of financial market participants, with potential consequences to financial stability. Given the Canadian economy’s reliance on carbon-intensive activities, its financial system could be particularly vulnerable to transition risks under some adverse scenarios. Clear climate policy, a smooth and steady transition and financial disclosure of climate-related risks could contribute to the correct pricing of risks and assets and a more efficient allocation of capital, mitigating the risks to the macroeconomy and the financial system. Assessing the impacts of physical and transition risks of climate change on the financial system is one of the most urgent and prominent issues. However, uncertainties around the course of climate change itself, the breadth and complexity of the transmission channels, the direct and indirect impacts, and the need to consider, in aggregate, some combination of both physical and transition risks make it particularly challenging. Given the sensitivity of results to these underlying assumptions, hypothetical climate and transition scenarios can be used to explore the direction and broad scale of outcomes. Sector- and country-specific scenarios based on current national climate policy can be developed to create realistic gradual and abrupt transition scenarios to assess the impacts on multiple levels (individual firms, the real economy, financial institutions and the larger financial system), taking into account feedback loops and spillover effects. Much of the work on the effects of transition risk on financial stability uses a combination of scenario analysis, energy models, IAMs and network models to assess the potential for stranded assets and value to create credit and market risk. Stock-flow consistent models and agent-based models might also provide a valuable alternative for a complex adaptive system in which heterogeneity, non-linearities and disequilibrium phenomena play a key role. Given the degree of interconnectedness in the economy and the financial system, it is important to assess both the direct impacts of physical and transition risks and the indirect and second-round effects. This implies accounting for exposures along the whole production chain, the transmission of shocks through financial linkages and feedback loops between the macroeconomy and the financial sector. Below, we discuss some of the key research questions in this area, including: The identification of the transmission channels of climate-related risks to the financial system The extent to which markets and investors internalize carbon risks The assessment of exposure of financial market participants to climate-related risk and the resilience of the financial system to hypothetical climate and transition scenarios Direct and indirect transmission channels for physical and transition risk First, it would be useful to identify which risks are most pressing, so research could be more concretely focused on specific short-term impacts for particular sectors, geographies and asset classes as well as the macroeconomic and financial stability implications. Real estate, agriculture and transportation are sectors that are both important and immediately exposed to physical impacts of climate change, which could affect banks and insurers exposed to these sectors on both the assets and liabilities sides of their balance sheets. Similarly, the oil and gas sector and other carbon-intensive sectors, such as transportation, electricity generation, infrastructure and carbon-intensive industrial technologies, could be vulnerable to transition risks under some adverse transition scenarios. The Bank will leverage existing research and analysis by other institutions, as well as its own research, to inform the identification of risks and deepen our understanding of the transmission channels of physical and transition risks. Important issues to explore are the longer-term climate change implications for the profitability and viability of particular sectors (e.g., insurance and reinsurance) and their macrofinancial consequences. The extent to which markets and investors internalize carbon risks Some recent literature has assessed the extent to which investors and markets are internalizing risks related to climate change. Using standard event methodology, it is possible to examine the market reaction to specific events, which could be associated with a change in market expectations about the profitability in investing in carbon-intensive activities. To date, the literature has found evidence that there is a limited but growing sensitivity to carbon risks. The Bank is partnering with academic researchers to further explore this question. The climate-related risk exposures of financial market participants and the resilience of the financial system to hypothetical climate and transition scenarios Understanding the climate-related risk exposures (business, credit, underwriting, market and legal risk) of P&C insurers and re-insurers, banks, pension funds, investment funds and real estate investment trusts is a priority for central banks and financial regulators. Several central banks and supervisors have, for example, compared geographic distribution of insurance coverage and retail lending activity with that of extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes and floods). Others have looked to quantify the exposure of financial portfolios to transition risk by identifying the proportion of assets (e.g., equities and corporate bonds) held in sectors most at risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy. While these approaches capture first-round effects, they may not fully incorporate the wider risks of financial contagion from an unanticipated economic transition. As a first step, the Bank intends to evaluate direct and indirect exposures of Canadian financial institutions to climate-related risks based on available data. Some studies have combined exposure data and scenario analysis using network models to account for second-round effects. 13 These are current state-of-the-art frameworks in climate stress testing. An ultimate goal of the Bank is to develop climate stress-testing frameworks to assess the resilience of the financial system to hypothetical extreme but plausible scenarios. One of the key barriers to assessing climate-related exposures is the availability of data to support granular, bottom-up, quantitative analysis. To address this gap, central banks and regulatory authorities must co-operate and combine standard macroeconomic, financial market and supervisory reporting data with new climate databases.

Dietz and Stern (2015) and others suggest that climate change might have long-lasting effects on growth and propose models of endogenous growth with knowledge spillovers, endogenous TFP and damage to TFP. These models imply much larger costs of climate change.[ ← ] 12. Instead of explicitly modelling uncertainty, IAMs typically rely on sensitivity analysis. However, this approach does not reflect the impact of uncertainty on decision making.[ ← ] 13. See Battiston et al. (2017) and Roncoroni et al. (2019).[ ← ]",html,2026-01-07 09:34:40,,,,,

Major economies around the world continue to show resilience to US trade protectionism, but uncertainty is still high. In the United States, economic growth is being supported by strong consumption and a surge in AI investment. The US government shutdown caused volatility in quarterly growth and delayed the release of some key economic data. Tariffs are causing some upward pressure on US inflation. In the euro area, economic growth has been stronger than expected, with the services sector showing particular resilience. In China, soft domestic demand, including more weakness in the housing market, is weighing on growth. Global financial conditions, oil prices, and the Canadian dollar are all roughly unchanged since the Bank’s October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Canada’s economy grew by a surprisingly strong 2.6% in the third quarter, even as final domestic demand was flat. The increase in GDP largely reflected volatility in trade. The Bank expects final domestic demand will grow in the fourth quarter, but with an anticipated decline in net exports, GDP will likely be weak. Growth is forecast to pick up in 2026, although uncertainty remains high and large swings in trade may continue to cause quarterly volatility. Canada’s labour market is showing some signs of improvement. Employment has shown solid gains in the past three months and the unemployment rate declined to 6.5% in November. Nevertheless, job markets in trade-sensitive sectors remain weak and economy-wide hiring intentions continue to be subdued. CPI inflation slowed to 2.2% in October, as gasoline prices fell and food prices rose more slowly. CPI inflation has been close to the 2% target for more than a year, while measures of core inflation remain in the range of 2½% to 3%. The Bank assesses that underlying inflation is still around 2½%. In the near term, CPI inflation is likely to be higher due to the effects of last year’s GST/HST holiday on the prices of some goods and services. Looking through this choppiness, the Bank expects ongoing economic slack to roughly offset cost pressures associated with the reconfiguration of trade, keeping CPI inflation close to the 2% target. If inflation and economic activity evolve broadly in line with the October projection, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. Uncertainty remains elevated. If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. The Bank is focused on ensuring that Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 28, 2026. The Bank’s next MPR will be released at the same time.

With the effects of US trade actions on economic growth and inflation somewhat clearer, the Bank has returned to its usual practice of providing a projection for the global and Canadian economies in this Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Because US trade policy remains unpredictable and uncertainty is still higher than normal, this projection is subject to a wider-than-usual range of risks. While the global economy has been resilient to the historic rise in US tariffs, the impact is becoming more evident. Trade relationships are being reconfigured and ongoing trade tensions are dampening investment in many countries. In the MPR projection, the global economy slows from about 3¼% in 2025 to about 3% in 2026 and 2027. In the United States, economic activity has been strong, supported by the boom in AI investment. At the same time, employment growth has slowed and tariffs have started to push up consumer prices. Growth in the euro area is decelerating due to weaker exports and slowing domestic demand. In China, lower exports to the United States have been offset by higher exports to other countries, but business investment has weakened. Global financial conditions have eased further since July and oil prices have been fairly stable. The Canadian dollar has depreciated slightly against the US dollar. Canada’s economy contracted by 1.6% in the second quarter, reflecting a drop in exports and weak business investment amid heightened uncertainty. Meanwhile, household spending grew at a healthy pace. US trade actions and related uncertainty are having severe effects on targeted sectors including autos, steel, aluminum, and lumber. As a result, GDP growth is expected to be weak in the second half of the year. Growth will get some support from rising consumer and government spending and residential investment, and then pick up gradually as exports and business investment begin to recover. Canada’s labour market remains soft. Employment gains in September followed two months of sizeable losses. Job losses continue to build in trade-sensitive sectors and hiring has been weak across the economy. The unemployment rate remained at 7.1% in September and wage growth has slowed. Slower population growth means fewer new jobs are needed to keep the employment rate steady. The Bank projects GDP will grow by 1.2% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026 and 1.6% in 2027. On a quarterly basis, growth strengthens in 2026 after a weak second half of this year. Excess capacity in the economy is expected to persist and be taken up gradually. CPI inflation was 2.4% in September, slightly higher than the Bank had anticipated. Inflation excluding taxes was 2.9%. The Bank’s preferred measures of core inflation have been sticky around 3%. Expanding the range of indicators to include alternative measures of core inflation and the distribution of price changes among CPI components suggests underlying inflation remains around 2½%. The Bank expects inflationary pressures to ease in the months ahead and CPI inflation to remain near 2% over the projection horizon. With ongoing weakness in the economy and inflation expected to remain close to the 2% target, Governing Council decided to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points. If inflation and economic activity evolve broadly in line with the October projection, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. Governing Council will be assessing incoming data carefully relative to the Bank’s forecast. The Canadian economy faces a difficult transition. The structural damage caused by the trade conflict reduces the capacity of the economy and adds costs. This limits the role that monetary policy can play to boost demand while maintaining low inflation. The Bank is focused on ensuring that Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is December 10, 2025. The Bank’s next MPR will be released on January 28, 2026. Monetary Policy Report—October 2025 Canada’s economy is adjusting to tariffs and the sharp drop in demand for exports. The reconfiguration of global trade and domestic production is leading to higher costs. Total inflation has been around 2%, while underlying inflation remains about 2½%.

This worldwide effort was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to obtain global, comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of the FX and OTC derivatives markets. The Bank of Canada today released the summary results of its survey. 1 As well, the BIS recently issued a press release that summarizes highlights of the aggregated global turnover. All dealers in Canada that are active in the wholesale FX and OTC derivatives markets were surveyed. 2 With respect to FX, the survey covered spot transactions, outright forwards, FX swaps, currency swaps and OTC FX options. 3 The interest rate products covered were forward-rate agreements, interest rate swaps, overnight index swaps and OTC interest rate options. Highlights from the 2025 survey Average daily turnover in Canada increased from US$172 billion in 2022 to US$233 billion in 2025, an increase of 35 percent ( Table 1 ). Total turnover of FX transactions in Canada rose from US$3.4 trillion in April 2022 to over US$5.1 trillion in April 2025. Canada’s share of global turnover increased slightly to 1.9 percent in 2025 from 1.8 percent in 2022. Single-currency interest rate derivatives turnover in April 2025 increased by 110 percent to US$3.0 trillion from the US$1.4 trillion recorded in 2022 ( Table 2 ). The increase was driven primarily by forward rate agreements and overnight index swaps. The composition of FX business by type of instrument or product and by type of counterparty is shown in Table 3 . Although total turnover increased in all categories in 2025 relative to 2022, the proportion of spot, outright forwards, and options remained about the same as 2022, while the proportion of FX swaps fell. There was an increase in the proportion of currency swaps. Table 4 shows the breakdown by currency of foreign exchange market activity in Canada. The share of Canadian dollars and US dollars increased slightly, while the share of euros and Pound Sterling decreased. The US dollar, the Canadian dollar and the euro were the top three traded currencies in Canada. Table 5 provides more detailed information on the turnover in foreign exchange products in Canada. The survey includes an execution methods table for foreign exchange contracts ( Table 6 ). About 60 percent of trades were executed by voice, while about 40 per cent were executed electronically. Table 7 provides a maturity breakdown for outright forwards and FX swaps. The majority of outright forwards have a maturity of between seven days and one month. The majority of FX swaps have a maturity of less than seven days.",html,2026-01-07 09:34:46,,,,,

After remaining resilient to sharply higher US tariffs and ongoing uncertainty, global economic growth is showing signs of slowing. In the United States, business investment has been strong but consumers are cautious and employment gains have slowed. US inflation has picked up in recent months as businesses appear to be passing on some tariff costs to consumer prices. Growth in the euro area has moderated as US tariffs affect trade. China’s economy held up in the first half of the year but growth appears to be softening as investment weakens. Global oil prices are close to their levels assumed in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Financial conditions have eased further, with higher equity prices and lower bond yields. Canada’s exchange rate has been stable relative to the US dollar. Canada’s GDP declined by about 1½% in the second quarter, as expected, with tariffs and trade uncertainty weighing heavily on economic activity. Exports fell by 27% in the second quarter, a sharp reversal from first-quarter gains when companies were rushing orders to get ahead of tariffs. Business investment also declined in the second quarter. Consumption and housing activity both grew at a healthy pace. In the months ahead, slow population growth and the weakness in the labour market will likely weigh on household spending. Employment has declined in the past two months since the Bank’s July MPR was published. Job losses have largely been concentrated in trade-sensitive sectors, while employment growth in the rest of the economy has slowed, reflecting weak hiring intentions. The unemployment rate has moved up since March, hitting 7.1% in August, and wage growth has continued to ease. CPI inflation was 1.9% in August, the same as at the time of the July MPR. Excluding taxes, inflation was 2.4%. Preferred measures of core inflation have been around 3% in recent months, but on a monthly basis the upward momentum seen earlier this year has dissipated. A broader range of indicators, including alternative measures of core inflation and the distribution of price changes across CPI components, continue to suggest underlying inflation is running around 2½%. The federal government’s recent decision to remove most retaliatory tariffs on imported goods from the US will mean less upward pressure on the prices of these goods going forward. With a weaker economy and less upside risk to inflation, Governing Council judged that a reduction in the policy rate was appropriate to better balance the risks. Looking ahead, the disruptive effects of shifts in trade will continue to add costs even as they weigh on economic activity. Governing Council is proceeding carefully, with particular attention to the risks and uncertainties. Governing Council will be assessing how exports evolve in the face of US tariffs and changing trade relationships; how much this spills over into business investment, employment, and household spending; how the cost effects of trade disruptions and reconfigured supply chains are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve. The Bank is focused on ensuring that Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. We will support economic growth while ensuring inflation remains well controlled. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 29, 2025.

While some elements of US trade policy have started to become more concrete in recent weeks, trade negotiations are fluid, threats of new sectoral tariffs continue, and US trade actions remain unpredictable. Against this backdrop, the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) does not present conventional base case projections for GDP growth and inflation in Canada and globally. Instead, it presents a current tariff scenario based on tariffs in place or agreed as of July 27, and two alternative scenarios—one with an escalation and another with a de-escalation of tariffs. While US tariffs have created volatility in global trade, the global economy has been reasonably resilient. In the United States, the pace of growth moderated in the first half of 2025, but the labour market has remained solid. US CPI inflation ticked up in June with some evidence that tariffs are starting to be passed on to consumer prices. The euro area economy grew modestly in the first half of the year. In China, the decline in exports to the United States has been largely offset by an increase in exports to the rest of the world. Global oil prices are close to their levels in April despite some volatility. Global equity markets have risen, and corporate credit spreads have narrowed. Longer-term government bond yields have moved up. Canada’s exchange rate has appreciated against a broadly weaker US dollar. The current tariff scenario has global growth slowing modestly to around 2½% by the end of 2025 before returning to around 3% over 2026 and 2027. In Canada, US tariffs are disrupting trade but overall, the economy is showing some resilience so far. After robust growth in the first quarter of 2025 due to a pull-forward in exports to get ahead of tariffs, GDP likely declined by about 1.5% in the second quarter. This contraction is mostly due to a sharp reversal in exports following the pull-forward, as well as lower US demand for Canadian goods due to tariffs. Growth in business and household spending is being restrained by uncertainty. Labour market conditions have weakened in sectors affected by trade, but employment has held up in other parts of the economy. The unemployment rate has moved up gradually since the beginning of the year to 6.9% in June and wage growth has continued to ease. A number of economic indicators suggest excess supply in the economy has increased since January. In the current tariff scenario , after contracting in the second quarter, GDP growth picks up to about 1% in the second half of this year as exports stabilize and household spending increases gradually. In this scenario, economic slack persists in 2026 and diminishes as growth picks up to close to 2% in 2027. In the de-escalation scenario , economic growth rebounds faster, while in the escalation scenario , the economy contracts through the rest of this year. CPI inflation was 1.9% in June, up slightly from the previous month. Excluding taxes, inflation rose to 2.5% in June, up from around 2% in the second half of last year. This largely reflects an increase in non-energy goods prices. High shelter price inflation remains the main contributor to overall inflation, but it continues to ease. Based on a range of indicators, underlying inflation is assessed to be around 2½%. In the current tariff scenario , total inflation stays close to 2% over the scenario horizon as the upward and downward pressures on inflation roughly offset. There are risks around this inflation scenario. As the alternative scenarios illustrate, lower tariffs would reduce the direct upward pressure on inflation and higher tariffs would increase it. In addition, many businesses are reporting costs related to sourcing new suppliers and developing new markets. These costs could add upward pressure to consumer prices. With still high uncertainty, the Canadian economy showing some resilience, and ongoing pressures on underlying inflation, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate unchanged. We will continue to assess the timing and strength of both the downward pressures on inflation from a weaker economy and the upward pressures on inflation from higher costs related to tariffs and the reconfiguration of trade. If a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from the trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate. Governing Council is proceeding carefully, with particular attention to the risks and uncertainties facing the Canadian economy. These include: the extent to which higher US tariffs reduce demand for Canadian exports; how much this spills over into business investment, employment and household spending; how much and how quickly cost increases from tariffs and trade disruptions are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve. We are focused on ensuring that Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. We will support economic growth while ensuring inflation remains well controlled. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 17, 2025. Monetary Policy Report—July 2025 Tariffs are significantly higher than they were at the start of 2025, and it is extremely difficult to predict how US trade policy will play out. Canadian economic activity has slowed but is showing signs of resilience. While inflation is close to 2%, underlying inflation has picked up.

Since the April Monetary Policy Report , the US administration has continued to increase and decrease various tariffs. China and the United States have stepped back from extremely high tariffs and bilateral trade negotiations have begun with a number of countries. However, the outcomes of these negotiations are highly uncertain, tariff rates are well above their levels at the beginning of 2025, and new trade actions are still being threatened. Uncertainty remains high. While the global economy has shown resilience in recent months, this partly reflects a temporary surge in activity to get ahead of tariffs. In the United States, domestic demand remained relatively strong but higher imports pulled down first-quarter GDP. US inflation has ticked down but remains above 2%, with the price effects of tariffs still to come. In Europe, economic growth has been supported by exports, while defence spending is set to increase. China’s economy has slowed as the effects of past fiscal support fade. More recently, high tariffs have begun to curtail Chinese exports to the US. Since the financial market turmoil in April, risk assets have largely recovered and volatility has diminished, although markets remain sensitive to US policy announcements. Oil prices have fluctuated but remain close to their levels at the time of the April MPR. In Canada, economic growth in the first quarter came in at 2.2%, slightly stronger than the Bank had forecast, while the composition of GDP growth was largely as expected. The pull-forward of exports to the United States and inventory accumulation boosted activity, with final domestic demand roughly flat. Strong spending on machinery and equipment held up growth in business investment by more than expected. Consumption slowed from its very strong fourth-quarter pace, but continued to grow despite a large drop in consumer confidence. Housing activity was down, driven by a sharp contraction in resales. Government spending also declined. The labour market has weakened, particularly in trade-intensive sectors, and unemployment has risen to 6.9%. The economy is expected to be considerably weaker in the second quarter, with the strength in exports and inventories reversing and final domestic demand remaining subdued. CPI inflation eased to 1.7% in April, as the elimination of the federal consumer carbon tax reduced inflation by 0.6 percentage points. Excluding taxes, inflation rose 2.3% in April, slightly stronger than the Bank had expected. The Bank’s preferred measures of core inflation, as well as other measures of underlying inflation, moved up. Recent surveys indicate that households continue to expect that tariffs will raise prices and many businesses say they intend to pass on the costs of higher tariffs. The Bank will be watching all these indicators closely to gauge how inflationary pressures are evolving. With uncertainty about US tariffs still high, the Canadian economy softer but not sharply weaker, and some unexpected firmness in recent inflation data, Governing Council decided to hold the policy rate as we gain more information on US trade policy and its impacts. We will continue to assess the timing and strength of both the downward pressures on inflation from a weaker economy and the upward pressures on inflation from higher costs. Governing Council is proceeding carefully, with particular attention to the risks and uncertainties facing the Canadian economy. These include: the extent to which higher US tariffs reduce demand for Canadian exports; how much this spills over into business investment, employment and household spending; how much and how quickly cost increases are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve.

We will support economic growth while ensuring inflation remains well controlled. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July 30, 2025.

Angela Larocque, a middle school teacher from Forest Hills School in St. John, New Brunswick and Nicole Feisst, a high school educator from École Clément-Cormier in Bouctouche, New Brunswick are the winners of the Museum’s fourth annual award. Both teachers helped students connect their interests and ambitions to economic reality through programs that included input from parents and professionals in the local economy. By involving the community, these programs provided students with an approach to learning financial literacy that goes beyond the theoretical. Angela Larocque moved economic education outside the classroom through community-based financial literacy initiatives. These include “Idea Market,” an annual money-making entrepreneurship event, and “Money Matters,” a community financial literacy night. Money Matters brought together local businesses, banks, and financial experts, creating open, judgment-free conversations about money between families and financial institutions. Nicole Feisst created a comprehensive and personalized financial simulation for her grade 11 and 12 students. Each learner built a financial profile before navigating a realistic, and sometimes unpredictable, simulation of adult economic life. Local professionals offered real-time advice, grounding the experience in real-world insight. “Both Angela and Nicole’s projects are exemplary,” said Sharon Kozicki, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. “What set their work apart this year was how they brought the wider community—including parents—into the learning process. They introduced economic and financial topics in ways that were grounded in real life, creating experiences that will have a lasting impact on the youth who participated.” Each winner receives a trophy along with a personal cash prize of $1,000 and another $1,000 for their school. More information on this year’s winners is available on the Museum’s website . Nominations came in from across the country and were reviewed by a selection committee made up of representatives from the Bank of Canada and other experts in the fields of economics and education, and a youth representative. Nominations for next year’s award will open in early 2026. Notes to editors The Bank of Canada Museum creatively brings the work of the central bank to Canadians by demystifying the Bank’s key functions and interpreting Canada’s monetary heritage. It also provides access to Canada’s National Currency Collection which is comprised of over 130,000 objects.

The major shift in direction of US trade policy and the unpredictability of tariffs have increased uncertainty, diminished prospects for economic growth, and raised inflation expectations. Pervasive uncertainty makes it unusually challenging to project GDP growth and inflation in Canada and globally. Instead, the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) presents two scenarios that explore different paths for US trade policy. In the first scenario, uncertainty is high but tariffs are limited in scope. Canadian growth weakens temporarily and inflation remains around the 2% target. In the second scenario, a protracted trade war causes Canada’s economy to fall into recession this year and inflation rises temporarily above 3% next year. Many other trade policy scenarios are possible. There is also an unusual degree of uncertainty about the economic outcomes within any scenario, since the magnitude and speed of the shift in US trade policy are unprecedented. Global economic growth was solid in late 2024 and inflation has been easing towards central bank targets. However, tariffs and uncertainty have weakened the outlook. In the United States, the economy is showing signs of slowing amid rising policy uncertainty and rapidly deteriorating sentiment, while inflation expectations have risen. In the euro area, growth has been modest in early 2025, with continued weakness in the manufacturing sector. China’s economy was strong at the end of 2024 but more recent data shows it slowing modestly. Financial markets have been roiled by serial tariff announcements, postponements and continued threats of escalation. This extreme market volatility is adding to uncertainty. Oil prices have declined substantially since January, mainly reflecting weaker prospects for global growth. Canada’s exchange rate has recently appreciated as a result of broad US dollar weakness. In Canada, the economy is slowing as tariff announcements and uncertainty pull down consumer and business confidence. Consumption, residential investment and business spending all look to have weakened in the first quarter. Trade tensions are also disrupting recovery in the labour market. Employment declined in March and businesses are reporting plans to slow their hiring. Wage growth continues to show signs of moderation. Inflation was 2.3% in March, lower than in February but still higher than 1.8% at the time of the January MPR. The higher inflation in the last couple of months reflects some rebound in goods price inflation and the end of the temporary suspension of the GST/HST. Starting in April, CPI inflation will be pulled down for one year by the removal of the consumer carbon tax. Lower global oil prices will also dampen inflation in the near term. However, we expect tariffs and supply chain disruptions to push up some prices. How much upward pressure this puts on inflation will depend on the evolution of tariffs and how quickly businesses pass on higher costs to consumers. Short-term inflation expectations have moved up, as businesses and consumers anticipate higher costs from trade conflict and supply disruptions. Longer term inflation expectations are little changed. Governing Council will continue to assess the timing and strength of both the downward pressures on inflation from a weaker economy and the upward pressures on inflation from higher costs. Our focus will be on ensuring that Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. This means we will support economic growth while ensuring that inflation remains well controlled. Governing Council will proceed carefully, with particular attention to the risks and uncertainties facing the Canadian economy. These include: the extent to which higher tariffs reduce demand for Canadian exports; how much this spills over into business investment, employment and household spending; how much and how quickly cost increases are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve. Monetary policy cannot resolve trade uncertainty or offset the impacts of a trade war. What it can and must do is maintain price stability for Canadians. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 4, 2025. The Bank will publish its next MPR on July 30, 2025. Monetary Policy Report—April 2025 The Canadian economy ended 2024 in a strong position. However, the trade conflict and tariffs are expected to slow growth and add to price pressures. The outlook is very uncertain because of the unpredictability of US trade policy and the magnitude of its impact on the Canadian economy.

Specifically, the September letter noted that there could be tax consequences or administrative burden under the Income Tax Act for PSPs seeking to safeguard end-user funds using the “in trust in a trust account” method while retaining interest income on the end-user funds they hold.","Letter to industry - Update on Trust Tax Issue To: Payment Service Providers This letter is in reference to the letter published by the Bank of Canada on September 8, 2025, indicating that there may be unintended consequences under the Income Tax Act for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) seeking to comply with the Retail Payment Activities Act (RPAA) . Specifically, the September letter noted that there could be tax consequences or administrative burden under the Income Tax Act for PSPs seeking to safeguard end-user funds using the “in trust in a trust account” method while retaining interest income on the end-user funds they hold. Consequently, the Department of Finance Canada issued a letter to the Bank of Canada, stating its intent to amend the Income Tax Act to address the unintended tax consequences for PSPs . The letter specifies that: “trusts that are established by a payment service provider under the RPAA (or an entity contracted by a payment service provider to establish such a trust) to hold funds pursuant to the requirements of the RPAA be deemed to not be a trust for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and that funds deposited in those accounts be deemed to be loans from the end-users to the respective payment service providers. The trust would be required to at all times meet the requirements for a trust as set out in the RPAA . The payment service provider would also be required to have applied for, and not to have been denied, registration under the RPAA and would need to maintain registration once registered.” These intended amendments would apply to the Income Tax Act as of September 8, 2025, subject to approval by the Minister of Finance and Parliament as part of the legislative process. The Bank commenced its supervisory activities on September 8, 2025 . As of that date, applicants and registered PSPs are expected to comply with regulatory obligations related to operational risk and end-user funds safeguarding provisions of the RPAA . PSPs are also expected to provide information to demonstrate their operational risk and end-user fund safeguarding practices in response to the Bank’s supervisory inquiries. If a PSP chooses to safeguard end-user funds by holding them in trust in a trust account, it must ensure that retaining the interest earned from the end-user funds does not compromise or invalidate the trust arrangement. The Bank expects that a PSP will seek advice from legal advisors with appropriate expertise to confirm that the PSP is adequately safeguarding the funds and has established and maintained a valid trust arrangement. As a result of the letter from the Department of Finance, the Bank expects that PSPs will now be able to establish valid trust arrangements that comply with the RPAA when safeguarding end-user funds by using the “in trust in a trust account” method. The Bank recognizes that some PSPs may require additional time to take all necessary steps to meet trust requirements. In these circumstances, the Bank will seek information confirming that a PSP has taken steps towards meeting its obligations in a reasonable time.",html,2026-01-07 09:35:07,,,,,

The Bank and the Department of Finance have been made aware of possible unintended tax consequences for PSPs seeking to comply with the safeguarding requirements of the RPAA using the “in trust in a trust account” method. To hold end-user funds in trust, a PSP must establish a trust arrangement that forms a valid express trust arrangement. For PSPs retaining interest income on the end-user funds they hold, there may be unintended tax consequences or administrative burden (e.g. issuance of tax slips to the end-user) under the Income Tax Act . The Department of Finance and tax authorities are currently working with industry to resolve this issue in a timely manner and recognize its importance for PSPs seeking to establish trust arrangements as required under the RPAA . As the Bank has previously communicated to industry, while PSPs are expected to be in compliance with all in-force provisions of the RPAA as of September 8, there may be some issues that a PSP is still working on to meet its compliance obligations. In these circumstances, the Bank will take into consideration whether a PSP has taken all reasonable steps available to it to meet their obligations. Given this tax issue, and its implications for PSPs establishing a trust arrangement, the Bank recognizes that some PSPs may not be able to meet trust arrangement requirements until this issue is resolved and will recognize this as part of its supervisory activities. The Bank will commence its supervisory activities effective September 8, 2025 and PSPs should expect to provide information to demonstrate their operational risk and end-user fund safeguarding practices in response to Bank supervisory inquiries.",html,2026-01-07 09:35:07,,,,,

This summary reflects discussions and deliberations by members of Governing Council in stage three of the Bank’s monetary policy decision-making process . This stage takes place after members have received all staff briefings and recommendations. Governing Council’s policy decision-making meetings began on December 5, 2025. The Governor presided over these meetings. Members in attendance were Governor Tiff Macklem, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers and Deputy Governors Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki, Nicolas Vincent, Rhys Mendes and Michelle Alexopoulos. International economy Governing Council members began their deliberations by discussing global economic developments since the October Monetary Policy Report . Members agreed that the global economy was showing continued resilience in the face of US protectionism. In the United States, the absence of official data during the government shutdown clouded the picture. Available information suggested that strong consumer spending and investment in artificial intelligence had continued to support growth. Unemployment was relatively stable, although layoffs in the private sector had been increasing. Members discussed whether early indications of retail sales for Black Friday suggested US consumption could be boosted by more than usual for the holiday period. Rising equity prices was likely providing some support for consumer spending by wealthier households. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the United States had ticked up slightly in September, likely due to some pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices. Members noted that if the pass-through were to expand, there could be an upside risk to US inflation. In the euro area, growth now appeared stronger than anticipated in the October Report. The strength came largely from a boost in demand for services. Going forward, a surge in Chinese exports to the region could compete with local manufacturing and weigh on growth but increases in defence spending could offset these pressures. Growth in China was weighed down by weakness in household spending and business investment. Exports were supporting growth, and business investment was expected to show some improvement. Members briefly discussed global financial conditions, oil prices and the Canadian dollar. These were all roughly the same as they were at the time of the October Report. Canadian economy and inflation outlook Members then turned their attention to recent economic developments in Canada. Since the October Report, Statistics Canada published data on gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter and revised national accounts data for prior years. Upward revisions to GDP for the three years ending in 2024 meant that the economy began 2025 on more solid footing than previously thought. Demand was more robust leading up to the US trade conflict. Stronger investment and some improvement in productivity growth also increased the economy’s productive capacity. Members agreed that this may explain some of the resilience in Canada’s economy in the face of the trade shock. After declining by 1.8% in the second quarter, GDP grew by 2.6% in the third quarter, which was stronger than expected. Members noted that the strength in third quarter GDP was primarily driven by a large decline in imports. Additionally, the slowdown in inventory accumulation was less pronounced than expected and therefore less of a drag on growth. After a sharp contraction in the second quarter, exports were up but only modestly. Final domestic demand was flat, with declines in business investment and consumption. Members acknowledged that uncertainty and volatility in the data made it more difficult to get a clear signal about the strength of the economy. Given the absence of US trade data, members noted there could be more and larger revisions than usual going forward. They expected fourth-quarter GDP to be soft, with increases in consumption, housing activity and government spending offsetting weakness in business investment and net exports. Members were encouraged by the job gains reported in the Labour Force Survey for November. Three months of solid employment growth had pushed the unemployment rate down to 6.5%. While this was a sign the labour market was improving, a broader set of indicators showed a mixed picture. After large job losses over the summer, employment in the sectors most exposed to trade had stabilized at a lower level than before the trade conflict. Other sectors, particularly services, had boosted overall employment in recent months. Governing Council members noted that much of the hiring over the past three months was in part-time jobs. They also noted that vacancies were low and that surveys of businesses indicated that hiring intentions were subdued. CPI inflation eased to 2.2% in October, in line with expectations. With only one month of data since their last decision, members saw little change in inflation dynamics. Measures of core inflation were between 2½% and 3%, and the three-month measures generally remained slightly below the 12-month measures. Members agreed that underlying inflation continued to be around 2½%. Members noted that, in the next few months, CPI inflation is likely to rise slightly. Year-over-year CPI inflation rates of some goods and services components would be higher because the prices had temporarily dropped during the GST/HST holiday a year ago. Looking through the near-term choppiness, Governing Council still expected soft demand and ongoing slack in the economy to roughly offset cost pressures associated with the reconfiguration of trade, keeping CPI inflation close to the 2% target. Core measures of inflation were expected to ease gradually in the coming months. Considerations for monetary policy Governing Council members discussed key risks to their outlook, namely the evolution of trade policy and uncertainty about how the economy would respond to structural change. On trade policy, members agreed that the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) was a significant risk. The uncertainty leading up to and during negotiations would likely weigh on business investment. Members shared that business leaders they had met across the country saw the future of CUSMA as a significant strategic risk to their businesses. A worst-case scenario involving the dissolution of CUSMA and higher tariffs would be very damaging to the Canadian economy. Alternatively, a resolution of CUSMA negotiations that provided some stability in North American trade policy could spur on business investment. Members also considered how the economy would respond to structural changes stemming from the reconfiguration of global trade. The magnitude, speed and impact of these changes across regions and sectors of the Canadian economy was a source of considerable uncertainty. Moreover, the volatility in recent quarterly GDP readings was an indication of how challenging it will be to assess the underlying trends in the economy. Members acknowledged that fiscal and industrial policy measures were the appropriate tools to address this structural transition given that monetary policy cannot restore lost supply. Governments were providing support to sectors affected by tariffs and trade disruptions. The federal budget included measures aimed at increasing public and private investment, but members agreed it will take some time for the impact of these measures to be fully realized. GDP data for the third quarter and the revisions to previous years’ national accounts data suggest there is likely somewhat less economic slack than previously assessed. But particularly with GDP expected to be weak in the fourth quarter, members agreed that the economy remained in excess supply. While there was still a risk that higher costs stemming from the reconfiguration of trade could spill over into consumer prices, the effects had been limited so far. Slower growth in unit labour costs may partly explain why these effects have been limited. And subdued demand meant firms would be less likely to pass on cost increases to their customers. Members agreed that information since the last decision had affected the near-term dynamics of GDP growth but had not altered their view that GDP would expand at a moderate pace in 2026 and inflation would remain close to the 2% target. In sum, members agreed the Canadian economy was showing signs of resilience after a year of trade upheaval, but uncertainty remained high. They would remain cautious in interpreting incoming data given recent volatility and would be prepared to react if their outlook changed materially. Policy decision Taking all these developments into consideration, Governing Council assessed the stance of monetary policy. After cutting the policy interest rate in October—for a total of 100 basis points since the beginning of the year—Governing Council had indicated that if inflation and economic activity were to evolve largely in line with the October projection, the policy interest rate would be at about the right level to keep inflation close to the 2% target. Since then, members judged that the information they had seen was broadly consistent with their outlook. In this context, Governing Council decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 2.25%. Members agreed that a policy rate at the lower end of the Bank’s estimate of the neutral range was appropriate to provide some support for the economy as it works through this structural transition while keeping inflationary pressures contained. Governing Council members also discussed whether it was more likely that their next move would be to raise or lower the policy interest rate. Given the high level of uncertainty, members agreed that while the current policy rate was at about the right level in the current situation, it was difficult to predict when and in which direction the next change in the policy rate would be. Finally, Governing Council members exchanged perspectives on what it would take for their views on the stance of monetary policy to change. They agreed that uncertainty remained elevated and that they would assess incoming data relative to the Bank’s outlook. If a significant new shock were to materialize, or an accumulation of evidence indicated that the evolution of economic activity and inflation was materially different from what they expected, Governing Council was prepared to respond.",html,2026-01-07 09:35:26,,,,,

I’m pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss today’s monetary policy decision. Today, Governing Council maintained the policy interest rate at 2.25%. We have three main messages. First, steep US tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and lumber have hit these sectors hard, and uncertainty about US trade policy is weighing on business investment more broadly. But so far, the economy is proving resilient overall. Second, inflationary pressures continue to be contained despite added costs related to the reconfiguration of trade. Total CPI inflation has been close to the 2% target for more than a year now, and we expect it to remain near the target. Third, in the current situation, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains high and the range of possible outcomes is wider than usual. If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. Let me expand on how we’re interpreting the new information we received since we published our October Monetary Policy Report . In November, Statistics Canada published broad revisions to Canada’s economic growth numbers for 2022, 2023 and 2024. The revisions suggest the Canadian economy was healthier than we previously thought before we were hit by the US trade conflict. In particular, they suggest both demand and economic capacity were higher coming into this year. This may explain some of the resilience we’re seeing in more recent data. After falling 1.8% in the second quarter due to sharply lower exports, Canadian GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter. This was much stronger than we expected, but largely reflected volatility in trade. Final domestic demand was flat in the quarter. We expect growth in final domestic demand to resume, but with an anticipated decline in net exports, GDP growth is likely to be weak in the fourth quarter before picking up in 2026. The labour market is showing some signs of improvement. After declining through the summer, employment has posted solid gains for the past three months and the unemployment rate has declined to 6.5% in November. Since the start of the year, there have been significant job losses in trade-sensitive sectors. But in recent months, employment in these sectors has been more stable, so gains in other sectors—particularly services—have boosted overall employment. Looking ahead, however, we’re seeing muted hiring intentions across the economy. Inflation has evolved largely as expected. CPI inflation was 2.2% in October, and measures of core inflation remained in the range of 2½% to 3%. In the months ahead, we will see some choppiness in headline inflation, reflecting the temporary GST/HST holiday on some goods and services a year ago. This is likely to push inflation temporarily higher in the near term. Seeing through this choppiness, we expect ongoing economic slack to roughly offset cost pressures associated with the reconfiguration of trade, keeping CPI inflation close to the 2% target. The recent federal budget includes increases in government spending, particularly in defence, and measures to increase public and private sector investment. It will take some time for the impact of these measures to be fully realized, and we expect they will contribute to growth in both demand and supply in the economy. As usual, we will incorporate updated fiscal measures from federal and provincial budgets in our next economic projection in January. Taking all these developments into consideration, Governing Council assessed the stance of monetary policy. After cutting the policy interest rate in September and October, Governing Council had indicated that if inflation and economic activity were to evolve broadly in line with the October projection, the policy rate would be about right. While information since the last decision has affected the near-term dynamics of GDP growth, it has not changed our view that GDP will expand at a moderate pace in 2026 and inflation will remain close to target. Governing Council therefore decided to hold the policy rate unchanged. We agreed that a policy rate at the lower end of the neutral range was appropriate to provide some support for the economy as it works through this structural transition while keeping inflationary pressures contained. Finally, Governing Council acknowledged that uncertainty remains elevated. This includes the unpredictability of US trade policy. In particular, the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement is creating uncertainty for many businesses. There is also uncertainty about how the Canadian economy will adjust to higher tariffs. The volatility we’re seeing in trade and quarterly GDP make it more difficult to assess the underlying momentum of the economy. We will be assessing incoming data relative to our outlook. If a new shock or an accumulation of evidence materially change the outlook, we are prepared to respond. Increased trade friction with the United States means our economy works less efficiently, with higher costs and less income. This is more than a cyclical downturn—it’s a structural transition. Monetary policy cannot restore lost supply. But it can help the economy adjust as long as inflation is well controlled. The Bank of Canada is focused on ensuring Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. With that, the Senior Deputy Governor and I would be pleased to take your questions.

Productivity is a topic that comes up a lot. It’s an issue that features prominently in the media, public discussions and political debates. And with good reason. Productivity, after all, is an engine of wealth. It allows the economy to grow despite limited resources. Unfortunately, as I am sure you know, Canada’s productivity has been weak for some time. The Bank has highlighted this repeatedly. 1 But the situation has grown more urgent. Shocks to our economy have become more frequent, and we are too vulnerable to their impacts. Stronger productivity would help protect us from these shocks. It would also give us the momentum to seize opportunities in a rapidly changing world. I have three goals in mind for today. First, I want to clarify what productivity is and explain why it matters for everyone—not just businesspeople and economists. I’ll also give a brief overview of the current state of productivity in Canada. Second, I will explain the scale and complexity of our productivity problem. To put it bluntly, we’re stuck in a vicious circle. When productivity is weak, it’s much harder to meet current challenges and seize opportunities for the future. There is no quick or easy way to improve productivity, and no single sector can do it alone. The challenge is complex, and long-standing structural issues are at play. If we want to fix this, we’ll need to be thoughtful, systematic and resolute. Finally, I’ll end on a positive note by talking about some levers that could help us reverse course. Improving our productivity won’t be easy. But we can create a virtuous circle that benefits us all. We owe it to ourselves—and to future generations. What is productivity and why does it matter? Let’s start with the basics. What is productivity, and why is it so important? I know this audience is well versed in this topic. But improving productivity should be a priority for everyone—not just experts—because weak productivity affects everyone. So let me take a brief detour to make sure we are all on the same page. In my conversations with workers and employers, I’ve learned that many think boosting productivity means people will have to work harder and longer. However, this is not what economists mean by productivity. Fundamentally, productivity is a way to measure how efficiently inputs, such as labour and capital, are used to produce a good or service. There are several measures of productivity, but labour productivity is one of the more commonly used in public discussions. This measure is calculated by dividing the value of goods and services produced by the amount of labour that it took to produce them. 2 At a national level, labour productivity is expressed by dividing gross domestic product (GDP) by total hours worked. Looking at productivity in this light helps dispel the notion that being more productive means working harder and longer. Instead, it means producing more with what we have. It means producing better . While labour productivity can be measured for a given quarter, looking at data over a longer period is generally more revealing. A lot of different factors can affect output and labour in the short term. But they may not have much to do with the long-term trend in productivity. 3 That said, Canada’s productivity has been lagging for the past 25 years at least. The data are clear. For example, the average annual growth in labour productivity in Canada was about 3% in the 1960s and 1970s but fell to 1% between 2000 and 2019 ( Chart 1 ). This decline continued through the pandemic and persists today. And it’s not one or two sectors that are causing the poor performance. Nor is it caused by differences in industrial structure. It’s a widespread problem across the economy. Even worse, over the past five decades, Canada’s productivity has deteriorated compared with that of other G7 countries ( Chart 2 ). In 1971, Canada’s productivity was, on average, higher than that of its peers. By the early 1980s, the situation had reversed. And the average productivity gap between Canada and other G7 countries has continued to widen since the start of the 2000s, particularly with the United States. Productivity is an engine of growth and wealth It’s fair to say that Canada’s track record on productivity hasn’t been stellar. But why should we be concerned? Why is there such a focus on it? The reason is that productivity is an important driver of growth and wealth. Our economic outlook and standard of living depend on it. In fact, historically, wage increases and productivity growth have gone hand in hand ( Chart 3 ). To better understand the link between productivity and wages, let’s consider the concept of cost. The most important labour cost for a business isn’t the hourly wage that it pays its workers. What matters more is what we refer to as unit labour costs—that is, how much it costs in wages to produce a single unit of output. This could be a unit of a physical product, such as a cubic metre of lumber or a wind turbine. It could also be a service, such as a medical visit, a concert or a web application. Let’s imagine a company that takes 10 hours to produce 100 units and pays its workers $40 an hour. The cost of labour to produce 100 units is $400, and the unit labour cost is $4. Now, let’s say a new technology or process lets the company produce 125 units in 10 hours instead of 100 ( Figure 1 ). Thanks to this gain in productivity, the company would be able to pay its workers up to $50 an hour without increasing its unit labour cost. The company could also translate the productivity gain into more competitive prices and thus increase its market share. Or it could even use the profits to invest in new, state-of-the-art equipment. Figure 1: Productivity gains mean extra profits for businesses Productivity gains generate additional profits that can be used to increase wages or investment or to reduce prices . So far, this example has focused on how productivity is important for businesses and workers. But productivity gains also help monetary policy. When the Bank looks at the factors that drive inflation, the relationship between rising labour costs and productivity is particularly important. The reason for this is straightforward: when productivity is strong, businesses can keep their prices stable even if they raise wages. Let’s go back to our example. If the workers’ hourly wage increased from $40 to $50 without any other changes, the unit labour cost would increase from $4 to $5. It’s hard for companies to avoid raising prices when that happens. But if wage growth is accompanied by an increase in productivity, it has less of an impact on unit labour costs, so it is less inflationary ( Figure 2 ). In concrete terms, this means raising productivity allows us to have higher incomes while also keeping inflation low and stable. In other words, our collective purchasing power rises. Figure 2: Productivity gains allow higher wages with less inflation Productivity gains help offset the inflationary pressures of rising wages. Deep down, Canada’s affordability problem is really a productivity problem. Inflation has come back down after spiking in 2022, but just about everything still costs more than it did before. Everyone is feeling this. If we want to make things more affordable, we need to raise our income. And the way to grow our income is by increasing productivity. Even modest improvements can make a big difference. To give you an idea, if our productivity growth since 2000 had been similar to that of other G7 countries, our GDP in Canada today would be about 9% higher, which translates to almost $7,000 per person. 4 And as I mentioned earlier, income growth linked to an increase in productivity would come with little or no inflationary pressure. So it would represent real growth in our purchasing power. But the benefits wouldn’t end there. With higher wages, we could bolster our retirement savings. And when tax revenues are higher, governments have more budgetary flexibility. They can provide better public services without raising taxes. 5 Or they can fund upgrades to our infrastructure, helping the economy become even more productive and further improving our standard of living. This is an example of the circular nature of productivity—a point that I will come back to later. Productivity fuels resilience On top of improving our standard of living over the long term, strong productivity also makes us more resilient to shocks and headwinds. In this sense, strong productivity is like having a healthy immune system that can help our economy defend itself and recover quickly. 6 But that’s not all. It’s also like having the well-developed muscles we need to go on the offensive. It gives us the strength and agility to seize opportunities and stake a claim in a constantly changing world. And the world is changing a lot these days. Consider, for example, the geopolitical tensions, shifting global trade policies and real-time reconfiguration of supply chains we’re facing. All this puts pressure on the supply of goods and services globally and raises the risk of inflationary shocks. 7 Better productivity wouldn’t just help us deal with these disruptions. It would also generate growth with less inflation. For businesses, productivity gains make them more competitive on the international stage. Businesses with strong productivity are nimbler and have more room to manoeuvre. In fact, we know from experience that businesses with lower productivity are generally the ones that struggle to pivot in the face of shocks and end up having to close their doors. The radical change in US trade policy is putting our resilience and adaptability to the test. Canadian businesses have been forced to seek new suppliers and new markets. But are they well positioned for success? Several studies show the businesses that export the most are the most productive. 8 They have the muscles to take on foreign competition and the agility to rebound faster from setbacks. The link between productivity and exporting is at the heart of several of our theoretical models of international trade. 9 So it’s probably not a coincidence that the contribution of exports to our GDP began to slow at the start of the 2000s as the productivity gap widened between Canada and its competitors, particularly the United States ( Chart 4 ). To sum up, our competitiveness and resilience depend on our collective productivity. Better productivity would improve our economy’s immune system and our ability to withstand shocks. And it would give us the muscle to take winning shots against international competition. The vicious circle of weak productivity The challenge we face is amplified by what I call the vicious circle of weak productivity. When productivity is weak, it can be harder to strengthen it to become more agile and resilient. This insidious problem takes many forms. We know that Canada’s weak productivity holds back our ability to compete in international markets. We also know that Canadian businesses that are highly exposed to international competition have no choice but to constantly evolve and improve. This makes them more productive, competitive and resilient. 10 And that gives them greater flexibility to take risks and raise their productivity even more. The problem is that too few Canadian companies are set up to face strong international competition. This is in large part because businesses in Canada have been investing too little for too long ( Chart 5 ). It’s one of the main reasons for the country’s poor productivity. But Canada’s weak productivity itself is one of the factors that reduces investment. As I explained earlier, weak productivity growth weighs on the wages that businesses pay their workers. And the slower wages rise, the more fragile consumption becomes and, with it, household demand for the company’s products. Faced with sluggish demand growth, businesses are then less inclined to invest in new equipment or technology that could improve their productivity. Moreover, the impact of weak productivity on wages makes it harder to keep our best workers in Canada and to attract top talent from elsewhere. All this further reduces innovation and undermines Canada’s competitiveness. It also limits the flow of foreign capital into Canada and our ability to compete in global markets. These examples show that once an economy is caught in a vicious circle, it can be hard to escape. In her March 2024 speech, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers highlighted the urgent need to increase productivity in Canada. Now that the alarm has been sounded, it’s time to move from words to action. It’s time to get out of this loop. The first thing we need to do is recognize that weak productivity is a systemic problem that demands a coordinated approach across the economy. We need to make progress on several fronts. No one institution or group can fix it on their own—everyone needs to play their part. But, given the tensions and conflicts that are destabilizing our economy, reversing the trend is more urgent than ever. Shared adversity is a powerful catalyst. Let’s leverage it. How can we turn a vicious circle into a virtuous one? No doubt, the challenge we face is a big one. But by creating the conditions for a virtuous circle, we can shape a better future that benefits all Canadians. We will not only have more money in our pockets, but we will also have a currency that keeps its value, more diversified trade, and a more self-reliant and attractive economy. Canada has been a leader in productivity before, and it can be one again. 11 But we need to be realistic. Maybe Canada won’t catch up to the United States in terms of productivity levels. Regardless of our ranking in the world, we should learn from countries that are similar to ours and that are doing better. And we should make improving our productivity a shared project. So how do we do this? To start, we need to identify the most critical areas to focus on—what I like to call the levers we can pull. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I’d suggest three areas in particular: creating a better investment climate, increasing competition in Canada and investing in our talent—what economists call human capital. 12 Creating a better investment climate As I said at the outset, my colleagues on Governing Council and I regularly meet with business leaders across the country to hear about their experiences. These discussions often focus on the business environment in Canada and their impression that it isn’t very conducive to investment. This is not a trivial observation. As I mentioned, Canada’s low business investment over the past several years weighs on our productivity. While this is a complex, multi-dimensional problem, there are a few things we could do to improve our investment climate. The Governor spoke about some of this in September, so I’ll just give you a brief overview. 13 Whether it’s in meetings or surveys, businesses often tell us that Canada’s regulatory framework is too cumbersome, complex and far-reaching. They cite it as an irritant that increasingly prevents them from being more dynamic. This is the first lever we should pull. A certain level of regulation is essential, of course. But it’s fair to ask if we could regulate better. This could mean speeding up approval processes, re-evaluating the scope of some rules and reducing the overall uncertainty around regulation. We also need to address overlap, redundancies and contradictions between the different levels of government. The same is true for the barriers that hinder the movement of products and workers between provinces and territories. Upgrading some of our infrastructure would also lower the cost of doing business in Canada. For example, we could improve east–west transportation routes to broaden our domestic market or even build new port facilities to ship our products overseas. As well, to reduce our reliance on the US market, we should be looking to get more out of our trade agreements with other partners. 14 As many others have said before, these factors could improve our productivity and competitiveness by encouraging Canadian businesses to invest and grow. Speaking of expansion, we know that Canada has fewer large businesses than the United States. In general, larger businesses are the most productive—and the most likely to export and invest. For companies to form, and for smaller ones to flourish into larger ones, it’s important that a regulatory and tax regime support their development and growth. Increasing competition in key sectors That said, even though we benefit when our companies expand, this shouldn’t come at the expense of a competitive marketplace. Improving productivity also means finding ways to foster strong and healthy competition in the Canadian economy. Nobody in this room would be surprised to hear me say it can be very hard for new entrants to break into certain highly concentrated sectors with a few big players. Think, in particular, of telecommunications, passenger transportation and financial services. 15 These are sectors that are critical to the entire economy. Which brings me to the second lever we need to pull—competition. Competition has a positive impact on productivity. It encourages businesses to become more efficient, improve the quality of their products and services, reduce their costs and offer better prices. Competition isn’t just good for consumers. It also makes businesses more productive and resilient. And that’s why we need to review and rethink our approach to competition. Investing in our talent I’ve talked a lot about businesses today, but it’s important to note that improving our productivity also relies on people. More specifically, it relies on human capital—the knowledge and skills of workers. And that’s the third lever we need to pull. Indeed, we need to invest in the workers of today—and of the future—so they can do their jobs effectively, reach their full potential and advance in their careers. That’s because, as I said earlier, a more productive society isn’t one that demands its citizens work more. It’s really one that gives people the knowledge, skills and tools they need to generate more value in their work. Consider artificial intelligence (AI), for example. It’s a technology so transformative that it could dramatically increase our productivity. But it could also disrupt the labour market. To get the most out of AI while limiting the negative impact on workers, we will need to rethink some aspects of our approach to education, and we will need to invest in training. Investing in talent also means making it easier to recognize professional accreditations across provinces and territories, and the foreign credentials of people who move to Canada. Doing so would help attract the best students and workers from around the world. The Bank’s role In listening to me today, you might be asking yourself why a Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada decided to devote an entire speech to productivity. After all, the Bank has little direct influence over productivity, and the levers I just identified are outside of our purview. Ultimately, monetary policy cannot address weak productivity. Nor can it neutralize the economic effects of structural forces such as demographic change, trade reconfiguration or geopolitical uncertainty. But the Bank can play a role in encouraging a national dialogue. And in fostering macroeconomic conditions that are favourable to a collective effort to boost productivity in Canada. Keeping inflation close to 2 % is more than just a number. This mandate brings real benefits to all Canadians. For households, low inflation maintains their purchasing power. For businesses, it provides a degree of stability and predictability about costs and prices in the economy. That allows them to focus their efforts on improving their productivity and competitiveness, whether by adopting new technologies, improving their processes or training their workers. This is how—in the context of uncertainty—the Bank can create conditions that help businesses and governments design and deliver effective solutions to improve Canada’s long-term prospects. The Bank can also play an important role in public debate about how Canada can break free from the vicious circle of weak productivity. Through speeches, such as this one today, we hope to raise awareness among Canadians about the need to address this significant challenge. And through their research and analysis, many economists at the Bank are working to develop and share knowledge about productivity. Faced with such a complex challenge, we still have a lot to learn. So we will need to be both curious and humble. Conclusion It’s time for me to wrap up. I hope I’ve been able to convince you that productivity matters to everyone, not just to economists and experts. And I also hope I didn’t scare you too much with my description of the scale and the systemic and circular nature of the problem! Escaping the loop we’re in and creating a virtuous circle won’t be easy. It will take a lot of work, creativity and leadership to get there. And we will all need to pull in the same direction to reshape our productivity. But it’s worth the effort. If we are successful, we won’t just improve our outlook during the trade conflict and this period of substantial change. We’ll also set ourselves up for long-term gains that will benefit generations to come. And stronger growth in our productivity will mean we can increase our incomes while limiting inflationary pressures and making life more affordable. Even if the scale of the task seems daunting, there is an optimistic way to approach a systemic problem. That is, if we can reverse some of the factors that contribute to weak productivity in Canada, other improvements will follow, creating a ripple effect. This will strengthen the country’s immune system and give us the muscles to shape our own destiny, no matter what the future holds. And even though the Bank’s role in this process is limited, we will be there every step of the way. By keeping inflation low, stable and predictable, we will help create the conditions for businesses and governments to focus their efforts on getting our productivity back on track. I would like to thank Ben Tomlin and Dany Brouillette for their help in preparing this speech.",html,2026-01-07 09:35:26,,,,,

This summary reflects discussions and deliberations by members of Governing Council in stage three of the Bank’s monetary policy decision-making process . This stage takes place after members have received all staff briefings and recommendations. Governing Council’s policy decision-making meetings began on October 21, 2025. The Governor presided over these meetings. Members in attendance were Governor Tiff Macklem, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers and Deputy Governors Toni Gravelle, Sharon Kozicki, Nicolas Vincent, Rhys Mendes and Michelle Alexopoulos. International economy Governing Council members began their deliberations by discussing global economic developments since the July Monetary Policy Report . The impact of US protectionism on major economies around the world had become clearer. Trade flows had begun to shift, and ongoing trade uncertainty had weighed on investment in most advanced economies. Even so, global growth was resilient but was expected to slow over the next two years. Economic growth in the United States remained strong even with higher tariffs on imports. Members attributed much of this strength to the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. US consumer spending was robust overall, contributing to this strength. Consumption was likely supported by segments of the population who have benefited from buoyant equity markets. Employment growth had slowed, and tariffs were beginning to push up US consumer prices. After growth in US gross domestic product (GDP) rebounded in the second quarter of 2025, members expected it to moderate in the second half of the year and in 2026. Growth in the euro area was expected to moderate in the second half of 2025 because of weaker exports and slower domestic demand growth. Fiscal spending on defence and infrastructure could provide some support going forward. In China, growth was robust, boosted by strong government support for households and an increase in exports to other (non-US) countries, replacing lost exports to the United States. However, a sharp decline in investment was expected to contribute to slightly slower growth over the next two years. Members noted that slower-than-expected GDP growth in China could translate into weaker demand and lower prices for raw materials exported by Canada. Global financial conditions had eased further since the July Report, supporting spending in many advanced economies. Oil prices were around the same level as in July, despite some volatility linked to geopolitical events. Canadian economy and inflation outlook Members then turned their attention to recent economic developments and the outlook for growth and inflation in Canada. Since the July Report—where alternative scenarios for tariffs were presented—the impact of US trade policy on the Canadian economy had become clearer. Governing Council members agreed that it was appropriate to return to the usual approach of presenting a baseline forecast in the October Report but recognized that US trade policy was still unpredictable. The impact of US trade actions on Canada’s economy had become more visible in recent months. Targeted sectors, including automobiles, steel, aluminum and lumber, have been severely hit, but lower demand from the United States for Canadian goods and services was affecting the rest of the economy as well. Hiring across the economy was weak, as was business investment. Consumer spending was resilient, and housing starts and resales had both increased since the spring, albeit with regional disparities. Members noted that growth of consumption per person was strong in the second quarter. However, they expected slower per person consumption growth, coupled with slower population growth, would mean modest overall consumption growth in the second half of the year. Also, while accommodative financial conditions would support household spending going forward, people who are worried about their jobs would likely be cautious in their spending. Members agreed that the labour market was soft. Employment gains in September followed two months of large numbers of job losses, and the unemployment rate had risen to 7.1% from 6.6% in January and February. Members noted that employment growth was weak across the economy, but the decline in population growth meant that fewer new jobs were needed to keep the employment rate steady. Job losses since January have been concentrated in trade-related sectors, and firms in other sectors seemed to be retaining their workforces for now. Nevertheless, members expressed concern that weakness in the labour market could persist and broaden. Responses to the Business Outlook Survey showed that most businesses do not expect to increase staffing levels. And discussions with companies during regional outreach visits indicated that if demand from the United States were to weaken further, that could lead to more job losses. Members expected GDP growth to recover from the sharp contraction in the second quarter but remain weak in the second half of 2025. Growth was expected to be underpinned by consumption and supported by housing and government spending. The projection in the October Report shows growth strengthening in 2026 as exports and business investment begin to recover; growth reaches 1.6% in 2027. Excess supply is absorbed only slowly over the projection horizon. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation ticked up to 2.4% in September, higher than the Bank had expected. Most of the increase was attributed to gasoline prices. Excluding taxes, inflation was 2.9%. Governing Council examined a broad range of indicators of underlying inflation. CPI-trim and CPI-median, the Bank’s preferred measures of core inflation, remained stuck around 3% in September. Members noted that the three- and six-month measures of core inflation indicated that upward momentum from earlier in the year had dissipated, although these and other measures of core inflation remained elevated. Looking at the full range of inflation indicators, Governing Council concluded that underlying inflation was still around 2½%. Members acknowledged that year-over-year inflation would be choppy in the coming months due to base-year effects from the GST/HST holiday on some items at the end of 2024 through early 2025 and the elimination of the consumer carbon tax in April 2025. Members would be looking through this choppiness and watching indicators of underlying inflation for signals about the trend of total inflation. Members expected shelter price inflation and inflation in goods prices excluding energy to moderate. Excess supply in the economy was anticipated to put downward pressure on inflation. However, this would be offset by increased cost pressures linked to tariffs and the reconfiguration of trade. Given these offsetting forces, Governing Council expected CPI inflation to remain close to 2% over the projection horizon. Considerations for monetary policy Governing Council members discussed what the recent economic developments implied for the stance of monetary policy. They covered two broad questions: To what extent should Governing Council adopt a more forward-looking approach to monetary policy given continued elevated uncertainty? What is the appropriate role for monetary policy during this period of structural change brought about by the dramatic shift in US trade policy? In considering the first question, members agreed that while uncertainty about US trade policy remained high, after six months of experience with higher tariffs, some things were now more evident: US trade policy had shifted to protectionism and was unlikely to reverse. This meant global trading relationships would have to adjust to higher US tariffs. Indeed, global trade flows have started to shift away from the United States. US trade actions were having severe effects on targeted sectors in Canada, including automobiles, steel, aluminum and lumber. Exports to the United States had declined, and exports to markets outside the United States had increased. The labour market had weakened because of trade actions and the uncertainty surrounding trade policy. The removal of most counter-tariffs by Canada had reduced upward pressure on import prices, but businesses continued to report new costs from the reconfiguration of trade. These developments gave Governing Council members confidence that they could now be more forward-looking. By moving to a base-case projection in the October Report, they could assess incoming data relative to their forecast and balance the risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, members agreed that a wider-than-normal range of risks and uncertainties remained. Of these, members cited the timing and outcomes of ongoing trade discussions with the United States, the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, and how structural changes to the economy brought about by the reconfiguration of trade would unfold. Governing Council continued its discussions from previous meetings about the role of monetary policy during a period of structural change. Members shared views on how much of the current weakness was due to the trade shock, to spillovers from affected sectors to the broader economy, or to general uncertainty. They agreed that all of these were contributing factors. Even though growth was expected to gradually recover, the economy would be on a permanently lower path. The level of GDP was expected to be about 1½% lower at the end of 2026 than had been forecast in January 2025. They were comfortable with the assessment in the October Report that about half the drop stemmed from weaker demand and half from structural adjustments precipitated by the trade conflict. However, members acknowledged that this assessment was subject to considerable uncertainty. Members acknowledged that the structural adjustments to the economy could take a long time. Since these adjustments would also add costs for businesses as they adapt their supply chains, customer bases and business models, monetary policy would be limited in the amount of support it could provide to boost demand while maintaining low inflation. Monetary policy cannot target specific sectors or open new markets. However, members agreed that monetary policy could play a role in mitigating the spillovers from hard-hit sectors to the rest of the economy. It could also provide some stimulus to help smooth economic adjustment as long as inflation is well controlled. Policy decision Having agreed that monetary policy can provide some support to the economy through this period of structural change, members discussed the appropriate stance for monetary policy to do so in light of their outlook for growth and inflation. Governing Council agreed that a further reduction of 25 basis points would be warranted in October or a subsequent meeting given that the economy is anticipated to be weak and inflation is expected to remain close to the 2% target. This would bring the policy interest rate to the lower end of the Bank’s estimated range of the neutral rate, putting the policy rate on the stimulative side of the range. While members agreed that a cut to the policy interest rate would be needed, they had a range of views about the timing of the cut. Waiting to cut the policy rate at a future meeting would provide Governing Council with more information on the economy, including the extent of weakness in the labour market, input cost pressures and the recent persistence of underlying inflation. It would also provide more information on US trade policy developments and federal fiscal policy. However, with continued excess supply, labour market weakness, tepid growth expected in the second half of the year and inflation projected to stay close to the target, the arguments for cutting the policy rate in October were considered more salient. Governing Council therefore agreed at this meeting to cut the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points to 2.25%. Governing Council members also agreed that monetary policy was likely close to the limits of what it could do to support the economy in the current circumstances. They agreed that to be as clear as possible, they should communicate that, based on their outlook, they believe the current policy rate is at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. Members wanted to underline that this assessment was contingent on inflation and economic activity evolving broadly in line with the October projection. Governing Council also recognized that uncertainty remained elevated and the risks around the outlook were higher than normal. Members would be assessing incoming data relative to their outlook. If new information led them to conclude the outlook had changed materially, they were prepared to adjust the policy interest rate. Governing Council’s priority was to ensure that Canadians remain confident in price stability throughout this period of global upheaval.",html,2026-01-07 09:35:26,,,,,

I’m pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss our recent policy announcement and the Bank of Canada’s Monetary Policy Report . Last week, we lowered the policy interest rate 25 basis points, bringing it to 2¼%. This was our second straight cut and reflects ongoing weakness in the economy and contained inflationary pressures. We also published our outlook for the Canadian economy. In this context, we have four main messages. First, US tariffs and trade uncertainty have weakened the Canadian economy. We expect very modest growth through the rest of the year, with some pickup in 2026. Second, while this weakness is restraining price increases, the trade conflict is also adding costs for many businesses, putting upward pressure on inflation. We expect these opposing forces to roughly offset, keeping inflation close to the 2% target. Third, to support the economy through this period of adjustment, we have lowered our policy rate by 100 basis points since the start of the year. And finally, the weakness we’re seeing in the Canadian economy is more than a cyclical downturn. It is also a structural transition. The US trade conflict has diminished Canada’s economic prospects. The structural damage caused by tariffs is reducing our productive capacity and adding costs. This limits the ability of monetary policy to boost demand while maintaining low inflation. Let me turn now to economic conditions. While US trade policy remains unpredictable, its impacts are becoming clearer. Canada’s GDP contracted 1.6% in the second quarter as tariffs and uncertainty reduced exports and business investment. US trade actions are having severe effects on targeted sectors including autos, steel, aluminum and lumber. Household spending was resilient in the second quarter, with strong consumer spending and a pickup in residential investment. The labour market is soft. Employment gains in September followed two months of sizeable losses. Job losses have been concentrated in trade-sensitive sectors and hiring has been weak across the economy. The unemployment rate remained at 7.1% in September, and wage growth has slowed. In the second half of this year, GDP growth is expected to resume, but remain weak, averaging about ¾%. It should then pick up on a quarterly basis in 2026 as exports and investment recover, and average about 1½% by 2027. This implies excess supply is only taken up gradually. CPI inflation was 2.4% in September, slightly higher than the Bank had anticipated. The Bank’s preferred measures of core inflation have been sticky around 3% but upward momentum has dissipated. Looking at a broader range of indicators, underlying inflation looks to be around 2½%. The Bank expects inflationary pressures to ease in the months ahead and CPI inflation to remain near 2% over the projection horizon. If the economy evolves roughly in line with our outlook, Governing Council sees the current policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. We will be assessing incoming data carefully relative to the Bank’s outlook. If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. For many months, we have been stressing that monetary policy cannot undo the damage caused by tariffs. Trade friction means our economy will work less efficiently, with higher costs and less income. Even as economic growth recovers, the entire path for GDP is lower than it was before the shift in US trade policy. Monetary policy can help the economy adjust as long as inflation is well-controlled, but it cannot restore the economy to its pre-tariff path. The Bank of Canada is focused on ensuring Canadians continue to have confidence in price stability through this period of global upheaval. With that, the Senior Deputy Governor and I would be pleased to take your questions.",html,2026-01-07 09:35:26,,,,,

In focus: The economics of climate change Governor's Foreword 2019: Emphasis on stewardship December, 2019 The Bank of Canada has always prided itself on its stewardship—of the Canadian economy, of course, but also of the organization, its people and its resources. As I approach the end of my seven-year mandate as Governor, I find myself thinking more and more about the situation that I will hand over to the next Governor. Let me begin with stewardship of the organization. The Bank manages its resources through its medium-term plan (MTP), which is developed every three years in collaboration with the Board of Directors. Our 12 outside directors bring a wide diversity of experience to our boardroom, from the private and public sectors and from all regions of the country. Development of the MTP includes thinking about alternative futures and ensuring that the Bank is prepared to deal with them. For example, several years ago we decided that the Bank needed to prepare itself for the possibility that bank notes would someday become obsolete. That led us to invest early in experiments using distributed ledger technology (blockchain) and to think through the issues around central bank digital currencies. Today, we believe that cash will remain a popular payment vehicle, but we are already close to having a full contingency plan should it not. 2019 at a Glance $111.8B Gross value of marketable bonds issued in 2019 $73.6B Market value of liquid reserves held in the Exchange Fund Account in US dollars as at December 31, 2019 $1.3B Net income for the Bank in 2019 47 Bank research papers published in peer-reviewed academic journals 2.5B Number of bank notes in circulation $93.1B Total value of bank notes in circulation Canada’s Vertical $10 Note Explore and share the $10 polymer bank note featuring Viola Desmond. The Bank’s MTP is particularly rigorous around resources. We separate our resource plan into three buckets: core operations, investments and new mandates. The operational envelope has been stable for many years, consisting of 1,500 people (plus or minus 1 percent) and a 2 percent cap on annual expenditure growth. Investments are in addition to that and include spending on such things as renewing our headquarters, replacing technology and cyber resilience. For example, replacing our Canada bond auction system requires new purchases, plus some temporary hands to do the build. When the job is done, the system builders and consultants will leave; but some people will need to maintain the system, and they must then become part of the core operational envelope and fit within the cap. New mandates, in contrast, are about new tasks the Bank takes on, such as retail payments system oversight, which is expected to happen in 2020; this will eventually require a permanent increase in our core resource envelope. This planning framework prevents the sort of incremental thinking and spending that can enter any organization. Investments create temporary bulges in total spending but are overseen directly by management and by the Board of Directors. These extra layers of oversight help to prevent mission creep and cost overruns, especially in technology investments. Initiatives that do not represent an investment or a new mandate must be financed out of the core envelope through efficiency gains or reallocations, which can mean abandoning less important activities. For example, in developing the MTP for 2019–21, our leadership group identified the need to allocate resources dedicated to (1) developing a next-generation macroeconomic forecasting model, (2) creating a concrete contingency plan should issuance of digital currency prove necessary sometime in the future, and (3) advancing our analysis of the implications of climate change. Given these new priorities, our leaders reallocated more than 30 positions within our 1,500-person cap this past year. This was done collaboratively by our cadre of managers. All this fine stewardship is supported by top-notch succession planning and leadership development and a performance and compensation system with a heavy emphasis on leadership behaviours. Personally, I devoted more than 80 hours to one-on-one mentoring of senior leaders in 2019, as agreed with the Board of Directors. The organization accomplished many important things in 2019. The Bank opened and staffed a new operational site in Calgary, which is designed to take over all essential operations in case of a major disruption in Ottawa. Already, critical operations are being routinely managed jointly or being rotated between the two locations. We launched and began to implement a new cyber security strategy, integrating the Bank’s critical role within the Canadian financial system. We also provided material support to Payments Canada’s initiative to modernize Canada’s core payment systems: the new wholesale system will go live in 2021, and the retail system about two years later. In addition, the Bank pressed on with its own digital transformation, experimenting with several emerging technologies and exploring ways to deploy artificial intelligence and advanced analytics into its routine processes. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Bank’s communications. We have broadened the Bank’s reach and external impact; we published the first fully digital Financial System Review in 2019 and began layering our articles and speeches to make them more accessible and relevant to different types of readers. The Economy, Plain and Simple is our first series to use multiple media, and the Bank of Canada Museum set a new attendance record in 2019. 2019 at a Glance 72,310 Number of visitors to the Bank of Canada Museum 50% New Visiting Scholars who are women $281,456 Total staff donations to the Bank of Canada workplace charitable campaign 10 Consecutive years the Bank has been named one of Canada’s Top 100 Employers 5,000 Number of trees the Bank will plant to commemorate its 10 th consecutive Top 100 Employers Award 1,800 Approximate number of Bank employees (1,500 core + 300 projects) Let us turn now to stewardship of the Canadian economy. Amid the hype and breathless commentary around each variation in the data, one can lose sight of just how resilient the economy has been. That resilience has been sorely tested over the past three years, mostly through rhetoric and actions related to international trade. This has fostered deep uncertainty about the future of many businesses, in Canada and elsewhere, causing significant pullbacks in business investment and international trade. On top of this, there was yet another downdraft in global and especially Canadian oil prices to start 2019, deepening the already-severe adjustments to lower prices that had been underway since 2015. Finally, 2018 had seen several new prudential measures put in place to manage risks related to mortgages, along with several interest rate hikes. Last year at this time, the Bank was carefully watching to see how these developments would affect the Canadian economy, particularly the housing market. The global economy slowed significantly in 2019, but by year-end there were signs that things were levelling off. Indeed, the Bank expects global economic growth to edge slightly higher in 2020. This does not mean that trade turmoil and related uncertainty are no longer having negative effects: the level of global gross domestic product (GDP) is now permanently lower than it otherwise would have been in the absence of new trade policies. By the end of 2020, we expect the cumulative cost to the world to approach US$1 trillion, or over 1 percent of GDP. However, as companies adapt to the new situation, economic growth should pick up, albeit more moderately and from a lower level of output. Despite all this, the Canadian economy grew just a touch less during 2019 than we expected a year ago. This is because housing and related household spending stabilized and contributed to growth, even as soft investment and exports continued to hold back the economy’s expansion. In other words, Canada is not immune to global trade conflict, but for most of 2019 the negatives were offset by some positives. While many central banks cut interest rates during 2019, rates in Canada held steady amid these contrary forces. This prompted considerable commentary about policy divergence between Canada and the United States—even though US rates have now declined to Canadian levels, having previously diverged on the upside. Even so, Canadian mortgage rates were drawn down in 2019 by developments in the global bond market. This helped to support household spending and the housing market. It also served as a reminder that Canadian households are already carrying record levels of debt, which makes them vulnerable to future shocks. However, the new mortgage lending rules are having their intended effect, making the household sector more resilient to future developments. Inflation is on target and has been there for most of the past two years—a significant achievement in light of the turbulence the economy has been through. Inflation is on target and has been there for most of the past two years—a significant achievement in light of the turbulence the economy has been through. All this to say that the Canadian economy is in a good place overall, even if it is not in a good place everywhere. For one thing, we would prefer a more sustainable situation with more growth in exports and investment and more moderation in housing and household indebtedness. We would also prefer that the economy be better balanced regionally. Given continuing adjustments to low oil prices and ongoing transportation constraints, oil-producing regions of Canada continue to struggle relative to the rest of the country. Over history, it has been rare for all regions and all sectors of the Canadian economy to be expanding at the same time. Today’s conditions are in many ways the reverse of what we saw from 2008 to 2014, when oil prices and the Canadian dollar were high and conditions outside the oil-producing regions were challenging. In other words, even if the economy is roughly where it belongs, it is not true for every region or for every individual. There is work yet to be done—adjustments are ongoing, and confidence remains soft. The good news is that inflation is on target and has been there for most of the past two years—a significant achievement in light of the turbulence the economy has been through. Maintaining low and stable inflation is the central tenet of our policy framework, delivering financial stability to all Canadians and a well-functioning real economy and labour market. Today, unemployment is near its all-time low. In the past seven years, unemployment rates have fallen significantly across all age groups, even as labour force participation has risen. Overall, the economy is operating close to full capacity, with evidence of slack only in certain regions and specific sectors. In other words, the macroeconomy has made it home, after more than 10 years of difficult adjustments. 2019 at a Glance 1.75% Policy interest rate at year-end 76.99 US cents Exchange rate for 1 Canadian dollar as at December 31, 2019 $1.0B Amount remitted by the Bank to the Receiver General for Canada 2% Inflation-control target 1.9% CPI inflation 1.6% Canada’s real GDP growth as estimated at December 31, 2019 Watch Governor Poloz speak about the Bank’s 2020 Vision. Looking back on my term as Governor, I could not be more proud of the researchers and forecasters at the Bank, who have consistently done a superb job of guiding our policy deliberations. They have done timely analysis of trade actions; of new housing policies; of complex developments in the labour market, including rapid immigration; of large fluctuations in oil prices; and of the effects of uncertainty on business investment. The Bank’s forecast performance can easily get lost in the daily ebb and flow of economic data and private sector forecast updates because Bank staff deliver their forecasts only four times per year and let them stand for the subsequent three months. This is because monetary policy must act in a longer-term context that fosters stability, with a view to achieving the inflation target, rather than being blown around by shifting winds. A key complicating ingredient of policy making today is the presence of risks associated with elevated household indebtedness. Bank researchers have leveraged new datasets to help us understand consumer financial stresses as well as vulnerabilities in corporate debt funding. They have also developed new tools to allow us to take these risks into account in a formal way, which is a major advance in policy formulation and communication.

Looking back on my term as Governor, I could not be more proud of the researchers and forecasters at the Bank, who have consistently done a superb job of guiding our policy deliberations. Fundamentally, monetary policy depends on forming judgments across a wide array of such considerations, each of which is wrapped in uncertainty. Indeed, if one phrase can sum up the past few years, it is unprecedented uncertainty, for it has been far greater than normal and has touched every dimension of the economy. And these judgments simply could not have been made without exceptionally good advice from cutting-edge researchers and seasoned policy-makers. To sum up, I am increasingly confident that the next Governor will begin work with a vibrant, healthy and balanced organization, one that was just named a Top 100 Employer in Canada for the 10 th consecutive year. The new Governor will also begin with the Canadian economy in a much-improved condition, albeit still vulnerable to new adverse developments, whether international or domestic. The progress that has been made on both fronts can only be attributed to outstanding teamwork, from both my own executive team and our Board of Directors. My thanks to them all for their dedication to the Bank’s vision: to be a leading central bank—dynamic, engaged and trusted—committed to a better Canada. Stephen S.

And we start 2019 with more confidence that financial system vulnerabilities have stopped building and, in some respects, are improving. Monetary Policy The Canadian economy expanded at a solid pace through most of 2018. In this context, the Bank continued to reduce the amount of monetary stimulus, raising its policy rate three times. Meanwhile, the Bank and its partners explored the policy and economic implications of new technologies at the 3rd annual Global Forum on Productivity in June. Communications and Outreach The Bank continued to pursue new and innovative ways to engage with various stakeholder groups, including the media, financial market participants and the public at large. 2018 at a Glance A review of some key numbers related to the Bank of Canada’s work in 2018. Mandate and Planning Framework The Bank of Canada is the nation’s central bank. Its mandate is “to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada.” Financial System The Canadian financial system remained resilient in 2018. Its capacity to withstand adverse shocks was further enhanced by new mortgage finance policies and the continued implementation of other regulatory reforms. Funds Management Consistent with the objectives of the government’s debt-management strategy for 2018–19, debt activities focused on refinancing government debt coming to maturity, raising stable and low-cost funding for government programs and services, and maintaining a liquid and well-functioning market for Government of Canada securities.

It includes the financial statements and a message from Governor Stephen S. Poloz. Governor's Foreword Canadians can look back at 2017 with considerable satisfaction. We saw economic growth of some 3 per cent, the highest in the G7; more than 400,000 new jobs were created; and inflation remained very close to the 2 per cent target. Economic indicators paint a positive picture for 2018 as well. Monetary Policy The Bank’s stimulative monetary policy helped inflation come closer to its target in 2017. To kick off its five-year research agenda leading up to the next renewal of the inflation-targeting agreement with the Government of Canada in 2021, the Bank invited more than 50 external economists, academics, journalists and policy-makers to participate in a full-day workshop. Financial System The Bank has intensified its focus in recent years on identifying and assessing systemic vulnerabilities and risks in the Canadian financial system, publishing its findings twice a year in the FSR. New data describing individual loans helped to assess vulnerabilities in 2017. 2017 at a Glance A review of some key numbers related to the Bank of Canada’s work in 2017.

Governor's Foreword Economists love to debate the details, but for monetary policy, getting the big things right matters much more than getting the decimal points right. The past year illustrates this well, as the major economic themes we identified a year ago played out largely as expected. Monetary Policy The year 2016 marked the 25th anniversary of the monetary policy framework that has helped the Bank of Canada promote low, stable and predictable inflation. The inflation targeting agreement with the Government of Canada was renewed, and the Bank will maintain a 2 per cent target for total consumer price inflation until 2021.

When applying this framework to Canadian data, we find that interconnections within the financial sector could amplify the direct effects of climate transition risk on financial entities.","Mapping out the implications of climate transition risk for the financial system In recent years, leaders around the world have expressed the need to move to a low-carbon economy. This transition can create opportunities for investment in green growth but could also pose risks to the financial system and its participants. A framework to better understand climate transition risk The shift away from fossil fuels as a key source of energy will challenge the business models of some firms. How quickly and orderly this transition occurs will affect whether and how investors revise their expectations for the future profits of these firms. This, in turn, could lead to an abrupt repricing of some financial assets. Financial entities—such as banks, pension funds and investment funds—currently involved in financing these firms could be impacted by such sudden reassessments. And the financial distress in one entity can spread to others given the interconnectedness in the financial system. These issues are complex to analyze and model. Bank of Canada staff recently developed an analytical framework to map out the channels through which risks posed by the transition to a low-carbon economy could spread across entities and impact the broader financial system. Direct and system-wide impacts of climate transition risk The transition toward net-zero emissions will have varying effects on sectors in the economy. To understand the extent of changes to come, central banks have developed climate scenarios—a set of different possible futures that result from different paths of policy action taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Using such scenarios, financial entities can assess how the various types of risks they face—notably credit, market and liquidity risks—would likely evolve. These risks represent the direct impacts of the transition to a low-carbon economy on the financial system. Meanwhile, a financial entity directly exposed to sectors impacted by the transition may take steps to protect its balance sheet. These actions could affect other entities, given the level of interconnectedness among participants in the financial system. For instance, many entities share a common exposure —they may be exposed to the same set of firms or industries affected by the transition. That common exposure could lead to additional selling pressure on market prices—a fire sale . Also, financial entities often hold shares in other financial entities, known as cross holdings , so the financial losses of one entity could cause losses for other entities. Finally, because financial entities often share the same business model (e.g., like banks do), markets may not discriminate enough between them and see them all in the same light. Figure 1 shows how the direct and system-wide impacts may play out. Figure 1: The interconnected nature of the financial system implies that the direct impacts of climate transition risk can cause system-wide impacts Figure 1: The interconnected nature of the financial system implies that the direct impacts of climate transition risk can cause system-wide impacts How this applies to the Canadian financial system To understand the direct and system-wide impacts of climate transition risk in Canada, Bank staff conducted a study, assembling a large and novel dataset. This dataset contains information about: the direct exposure of Canadian financial entities to sectors that are likely to be impacted by the climate transition interconnections within and among types of entities in the financial system Collaboration with provincial and federal regulators as well as financial market participants enabled the collection of these insightful data. The study authors then applied a framework to these Canadian financial system data and mapped out the direct impacts of climate transition risk, finding the impacts to be generally modest. This partly reflects the limited exposure of Canadian financial entities to sectors of the economy that may be negatively impacted by the transition. Despite this limited exposure, the interconnections revealed in this study play a role in spreading the impacts of the climate transition risk to the overall financial system. In particular, common exposures, fire sales and cross-holding positions were found to be important transmission channels. Lessons learned This study significantly improves the Bank’s understanding of climate transition risk for the Canadian financial system. The data collected enable the better assessment of the links between financial entities and sectors of the economy that are likely to be impacted by the transition. The data also provide valuable insights into how different entities may respond to climate transition risk. For instance, some entities, such as investment funds, would likely spread and amplify climate transition shocks through the financial system while others, like pension funds, may help contain them. This study also presented the opportunity for Bank staff to engage in discussions about climate transition risk with various Canadian financial system entities, notably pension funds. This collaboration shed light on long-term investors’ perspectives and how they assess and manage climate transition risks and opportunities. This study also uncovered the many analytical challenges in assessing the effects of climate transition risk on the financial system. One such challenge is the lack of readily available data about direct exposures or interconnections within the financial system. This work highlights the need to establish standardized and systematic measurement and disclosure of exposures to climate transition risks. Another key challenge in evaluating climate transition risk is developing a simple yet comprehensive analytical framework to map out risks of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. This study is an important step toward this goal.",html,2026-01-07 09:36:13,,,,,

Results show that such risk currently appears modest but could become larger with climate change.,"Flood risk and residential lending In recent years, Canadians have increasingly been impacted by natural disasters. When a residential neighbourhood is hit by a disaster, houses, as well as public infrastructure, are damaged. For some homeowners, the financial impacts of this damage may be large enough to cause them to default on their mortgage. Because residential properties serve as collateral for both mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), lenders may also suffer financial losses following natural disasters. Natural disasters come in many forms—including storms, droughts and wildfires—but flooding has so far emerged as the most common and costly in Canada. To explore the potential impacts of natural disasters on the financial system, staff at the Bank of Canada looked at current and projected flooding across Canada. To help make sense of the findings in this study, Bank staff answered some key questions about flood risk and residential lending. What is flood risk? Floods can impact lenders—such as banks or credit unions—through residential mortgages and, to a lesser extent, HELOCs. These two types of loans are secured by the market value of houses. Flooding could leave some homeowners unable to pay back their loan, and as a result they could default on their debt. For instance, a flood may cause extensive damage, resulting in additional expenses—such as temporary accommodation—or a loss of income if the borrower is unable to work, leaving the borrower without enough money for their loan payments. Or flood damages could lead to a strategic default by the borrower. No matter the reason for a default, the lender becomes the owner of the house. If a property is worth less on the resale housing market because of flood-related damages, the lender may have to sell it at a loss. In other words, the revised market value of a flooded house could be lower than the balance of the loan remaining on the house. Banks and credit unions also lend to businesses and governments. However, this study did not look at the impacts on lenders when flooding severely damages commercial, industrial or governmental properties and structures. How did Bank staff assess the extent of flood risk among residential lenders? The first step is to have a good idea of where flooding could occur and the extent of damage expected. Bank staff collaborated with Public Safety Canada to obtain detailed information about the projected precise location and extent of flood-related damage that could be expected to occur in any given year. Public Safety Canada also provided information on how flood-related damages are expected to evolve under different paths of global warming. Second, staff obtained anonymized information from 63 Canadian financial institutions about loans that are tied to residential properties—namely, mortgages and HELOCs. The data were collected in partnership with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (for federally regulated lenders) and several provincial regulators (for credit unions). 1 In total, the study covered 7.7 million properties—almost all the mortgaged properties in Canada. Third, staff applied this loan-level dataset to the maps of projected flood damages and flood insurance, doing so by the first three digits of postal codes, known as forward sortation areas. A reason for including flood insurance information is that lenders’ potential losses may be less severe if an insurance policy covers flood damage. Finally, staff considered different scenarios—notably, a typical flood year and a more extreme 1-in-100-year flood. They then calculated the financial losses that lenders could expect, assuming that some borrowers will default on their loans and after taking into account the presence of flood insurance. Does flood risk represent a large concern for residential lenders? In an average year in Canada, flooding is expected to cause about $2 billion in structural damages to residential properties. Nearly half of these damages affect properties where households carry a mortgage or a HELOC. But the risk of credit losses by banks and credit unions depends on several factors, including key factors we discuss below. The study shows that an average year of flooding in Canada would result in only modest financial losses for lenders. For instance, in a typical flood year, the average lender incurs a loss that represents less than 0.1% of the total outstanding value of mortgages and HELOCs on its residential loan book. Even in the case of a 1-in-100-year flood, the average lender suffers financial losses equivalent to only 0.2% of its residential loan book. A key reason for these modest impacts is the large amount of home equity that borrowers have built up in recent years. Between the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the end of the second quarter of 2022, home prices in Canada increased by over 50%. This means that a homeowner with a mortgage owns a larger share of their home than they did before the pandemic. In other words, the mortgage now makes up a smaller share of the market value of the house. In the event of defaults, lenders will have a better chance of recouping their capital and avoiding losses. What factors determine whether lenders are more or less exposed to flood risk? A key finding is that flooding does not impact lenders equally. In fact, the study shows that for the 10% of lenders most affected by flooding in a typical year, the financial losses are about four times larger than those of the average lender. Five key factors influence the extent of a lender’s financial losses from flooding: Concentration of lending in flood zones —Small financial institutions sometimes have much of their lending activities concentrated in geographical areas that are prone to floods; therefore, they are more exposed to flood risk than large financial institutions are. Yet, for most lenders in the study, less than 30% of their loan portfolio is tied to properties located in flood zones. Concentration of lending on residential properties —Credit unions and small and medium-sized banks generally have a higher proportion of their loan book tied to the housing market than large banks do. Therefore, they tend to be more exposed to flood risk on residential loans. Probability of household default —The more likely households are to default on their debts, the more lenders are exposed to flood risk. The risk of default declines if a borrower has any of the following: insurance coverage, equity, liquid assets, ability to work and generate an income, or access to government support programs following severe flood events. Flood insurance coverage —Flood insurance reduces flood risk for lenders, but it is not mandatory in Canada. Across all homes with property insurance in our sample, the take-up of flood insurance coverage is around 38%. Level of borrower equity —As discussed above, a borrower’s probability of defaulting on their mortgage decreases as their home equity increases. At the same time, if that borrower does default and the lender assumes the loan, becoming the owner, the loss is smaller than it otherwise would have been. In the study sample, mortgaged homeowners had on average about 65% equity in their home as of the second quarter of 2023. How does climate change affect the assessment of flood risk? The number of severe weather events has increased in recent years because of climate change. In the past decade or so, Canada has experienced a series of very large and costly floods, including in Calgary in 2013, Montréal in 2017, Ottawa–Gatineau in 2019, Vancouver in 2021 and Nova Scotia in 2023. The severity and frequency of such events are expected to grow, which would increase losses for financial institutions. To account for the effects of climate change, staff considered scenarios with a rapid warming of global temperatures. In particular, the study revealed that climate change is expected to: expand the number and size of flood-prone areas, exposing more properties to severe flood damage increase the overall costs of damages to houses In an extreme scenario with global warming of around 4˚C by 2100, a severe flood event could result in a loss rate that is 2.5 times larger than the loss rate expected during a typical flood year in Canada—an average increase of about 0.6 percentage points of the overall loan book of the average lender.

Most Canadians have heard of Bitcoin, which remains primarily used as an investment. Ownership jumped in 2021, reflecting increased savings during the pandemic and greater availability of user-friendly platforms to buy Bitcoin.","Five things we learned about Canadian Bitcoin owners in 2021 As mentioned in the Bank of Canada’s Financial System Review , cryptoasset markets have been growing rapidly in recent years and have become somewhat more integrated into the traditional financial system. The most well-known cryptoasset is Bitcoin, which launched in January 2009. The Bank has been studying Bitcoin since 2016, using surveys to understand Canadians’ relationship with this cryptoasset. The results of the 2021 Bitcoin Omnibus Survey , like the results of previous editions of the survey, provide a wealth of information on the extent to which Canadians are aware of, own and use Bitcoin. The survey results also provide some comparable information on alternative digital currencies. Here are five takeaways from this survey: 1. Bitcoin ownership among Canadians increased sharply in 2021 The share of Canadians owning Bitcoin rose from 5% in 2018–20 to 13% in 2021 ( Chart 1 ). This increase occurred following widespread increases in the savings and wealth of Canadians during the pandemic. At the same time, some fintech companies began to offer cryptocurrencies alongside traditional investment products, providing consumers with a wider range of accessible and user-friendly platforms to buy Bitcoin. The results of the survey also revealed that Bitcoin purchasers in 2020 and 2021 relied increasingly on mobile apps to buy their Bitcoin. Purchasers used mobile apps much more than web-based exchanges, mining or visiting a Bitcoin ATM. Chart 1: Ownership of Bitcoin jumped in 2021 2. Most Canadians are aware of Bitcoin Like in previous years, about 90% of Canadians in 2021 had heard of the term Bitcoin. Investigating further, we surveyed respondents on their level of understanding of how Bitcoin works. For instance, we asked them whether they agreed with the statement that Bitcoin is backed by a government (which is false). Based on the answers to three such core questions, we found that 40% of Bitcoin owners in 2021 showed a low level of Bitcoin knowledge, which is a higher percentage than in previous years ( Chart 2 ). Also, 66% of Canadians who did not own Bitcoin showed a low level of understanding of how this cryptoasset works. Chart 2: Among Bitcoin owners in 2021, 40% showed a low level of understanding of how Bitcoin works 3. Investment reasons have largely driven the recent surge in Bitcoin ownership The survey asked owners of Bitcoin when they first bought this cryptoasset. Those who purchased Bitcoin in 2020 or 2021 accounted for about half of all owners in 2021. These recent owners are even more likely than earlier adopters to view Bitcoin as an investment vehicle ( Chart 3 ). Chart 3: Investment is the main motivation for Bitcoin owners 4. Most Bitcoin owners hold small amounts In 2021, the median amount of Bitcoin held was Can$500 worth, and 70% of Bitcoin owners held the equivalent of Can$5,000 or less. The value of Bitcoin holdings is higher for long-term owners than recent owners ( Chart 4 ) because long-term owners benefited from the significant run-up in prices that occurred during 2020. Chart 4: The median value of Bitcoin holdings was Can$500 in 2021 5. Large price corrections are the most common incident reported by cryptoasset owners In 2021, 25% of cryptoasset owners reported that their holdings had at some point lost significant value in a price crash ( Chart 5 ), up from 18% in 2019. Other adverse incidents faced by owners of cryptoassets include losing access to their wallet (11%), encountering a problem with a cryptocurrency transaction (9%) or stolen funds (7%).

This includes analyzing structural changes that affect the economy—like climate change. These changes could increase vulnerabilities to the financial system.,"Assessing climate change risks to our financial system Ensuring the stability and efficiency of the financial system is a key part of our work at the Bank of Canada. This includes analyzing structural changes that affect the economy—like climate change. These changes could increase vulnerabilities to the financial system. Partnering to learn more Climate change poses significant risks to the financial system and the economy. These include disruptions from more frequent and severe extreme weather events as well as risks stemming from the transition to a low-carbon, net-zero economy. Moving to a low-carbon economy will require work on a number of fronts—such as global policy action, technological innovation, more sustainable finance and large socio-economic changes. While these efforts to decarbonize economies create opportunities for investment and green growth, they also carry transition risks. This report is about these transition risks. For the financial sector, mispricing of risks could expose financial institutions and investors to sudden and large losses. It could also delay investments needed to mitigate the impact of climate change. In late 2020, the Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) announced plans for an innovative pilot project with some of Canada’s key financial institutions. Its main goals were to: build the capability of authorities and financial institutions to conduct climate transition scenario analysis support the Canadian financial sector in improving its assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks help the financial sector to better understand its potential exposure to climate transition risks The final report for this project was released on January 14, 2022. Our approach Climate risks are challenging to assess accurately: They have long time horizons, and it is uncertain what future policy and socio-economic factors might look like. They are global and economy-wide in nature. They are complex, varying from region to region and sector to sector. To overcome these challenges, the Bank and OSFI used scenario analysis—an innovative approach to gain a better understanding of transition risks. The scenarios in the pilot explore different possible future paths for both reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating their negative implications for the economy and financial system. They also include different assumptions for climate policy and the speed of technological change. This approach builds on expertise the Bank has developed through staff research and our participation in the global Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System . Most recently, we contributed to a number of publications to help improve global understanding of the impact of climate change on the financial system and world economy. It’s important to note that the pilot scenarios are illustrative. They show potential stresses on the economy and the financial system. They are not predictions or forecasts, nor are they stress tests of individual financial institutions. The scenarios also deliberately focus on transition risks rather than physical risks. These physical risks—and the steps we may take to mitigate or avoid them—could also have significant implications for the global and Canadian economies and the financial system. This is an area for future work. Key findings Through this pilot, participants used climate transition scenarios to explore new methodologies to support climate-related financial risk assessments. The exercise highlighted the need to develop consistent ways to analyze and disclose climate risks. And it helped participants identify data gaps and develop a deeper understanding and awareness of the impacts of the climate transition risks on their portfolios. The climate transition scenarios developed for the pilot showed that the economy as a whole will undergo significant structural changes as the world transitions to net zero. Substantial restructuring in many sectors may be required to meet climate targets. For commodity-exporting countries like Canada, the transition also carries risks of significant macroeconomic impacts. These are driven mostly by declines in global prices of commodities brought by changes in global climate policy. The pilot also highlighted the important role for innovation—for example, to scale up renewable energy technologies. And it was clear through this exercise that, whatever path is chosen, delaying action heightens the risks to the financial sector and to the entire economy. While the report does not make specific policy recommendations, it is an important contribution to the Bank’s overall efforts to better understand and model the economic and financial implications of climate change. Looking ahead Financial institutions and financial authorities are in the early stages of building their capacity to assess risks tied to climate change. Overall, this exercise was an important first step in helping them improve their ability to analyze these financial risks. This will put them in a better position to measure their exposures to climate transition risks. It will also allow them to assess strategic business opportunities as we transition to a net-zero/low-carbon economy. To assist the broader financial sector with these efforts, two supporting documents accompany the pilot project report. They describe in detail the financial risk assessment methodologies used in the pilot and the development and results of the climate transition scenarios . The Bank is also publishing the climate scenario data gathered for this exercise.",html,2026-01-07 09:36:13,,,,,

This article presents a final update of household debt payment deferrals through to July 2021. The original article provides additional details on the characteristics of debt payment deferrals by borrowers. As of July 2021, all loan deferrals granted in 2020 except for credit cards have ended ( Chart 1 ). 1 Arrears among borrowers with expired deferrals continue to exceed pre-pandemic rates across all products but are trending down since our last update ( Chart 2a ). As previously reported, renters tend to experience higher levels of financial stress than homeowners ( Chart 2b ). Overall, most borrowers with expired deferrals have resumed making regular payments. The lack of a noticeable increase in payment arrears despite the large economic disruption caused by the pandemic is encouraging. This reflects several factors: While many Canadians remain unemployed, employment and economic activity have rebounded strongly from their troughs in spring 2020. Policy-makers have provided households with considerable financial support and continue to do so. The Bank of Canada, through monetary policy actions, has pushed short- and longer-term interest rates lower, making credit more affordable for households. Although this is our final update on debt payment deferrals, we will continue to monitor household debt repayment. The Bank will communicate relevant findings through other avenues, such as speeches and the Financial System Review .

Alongside government support programs, these payment deferrals have played an important role in helping households manage pandemic-related disruptions to their incomes. At the same time, the large take-up of payment deferrals has raised concerns that household defaults could spike once the deferral period ends. In the following series of charts, we investigate what payment deferrals tell us about the financial health of households and the related risks to financial stability. We draw mainly on credit bureau microdata from TransUnion Canada. While our results are encouraging, it is still too early to reach any definitive conclusions because many deferrals remain active or have ended only recently. We plan to publish periodic updates to this analysis throughout the remainder of the pandemic. Chartbook: Payment deferrals in Canada Deferral rates are highest for mortgages. In total, around 16 percent of mortgages in Canada have been deferred since the start of the pandemic. As of September 2020, deferral rates have fallen significantly below peak levels, although many loans remain in deferral ( Chart 1 ). Chart 1: Deferral rates by loan type Energy-intensive regions, where households were already grappling with the effects of low commodity prices, account for a disproportionate share of borrowers deferring payments ( Chart 2 ). Chart 2: Distribution of borrowers across regions Many households are deferring payments for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. For instance, about one-third of deferred payments are for precautionary reasons or to repay other debt obligations ( Chart 3 ). Chart 3: Self-reported reasons for requesting a deferral Among borrowers who own their homes and are deferring loan payments, the most common type of debt deferred is mortgage payments. Nevertheless, almost one-third of deferring homeowners deferred multiple loans. Most renters who deferred payments did so for either a credit card or an auto loan ( Chart 4a and Chart 4b ). Chart 4a: Types of payments that homeowners defer Chart 4b: Types of payments that renters defer Sources: TransUnion and Bank of Canada calculations Last observation: September 2020 Most borrowers deferring payments have healthy credit scores. That said, borrowers with deferred accounts tend to have lower credit scores than those whose accounts are not in deferral. This is especially true among borrowers who rent ( Chart 5a and Chart 5b ). Chart 5a: Percent of homeowners in each credit score tier Chart 5b: Percent of renters in each credit score tier Sources: TransUnion and Bank of Canada calculations Last observation: September 2020 Most borrowers deferring payments are not near their limits on revolving credit products, unlike those who are severely behind in their payments.

This is most notable for credit card deferrals, while, in contrast, roughly half of mortgage deferrals are still active ( Chart 7 ). Chart 7: Status of payment deferrals As of September 2020, most borrowers with expired deferrals have resumed payments. In fact, arrears rates of expired deferrals are below rates that prevailed before the COVID‑19 pandemic. Of expired deferrals that are at least 30 days behind in payment, installment loans and auto loans among renters have the highest rates of arrears ( Chart 8a and Chart 8b ).

b52381519ef0f8673e51f1ca33c747dd9b382fbc691eeb1b064ee62b03120367,rss,英国,消息,2026-01-06 11:17:03,Minutes of the UK Money Markets Code Sub-Committee – December 2025,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2025/december/money-markets-sub-committee-minutes-december-2025,The Money Markets Committee is a forum for market participants and authorities to discuss the UK unsecured deposits and funding market and securities lending and repo markets.,"Minutes of the UK Money Markets Code Sub-Committee – December 2025 Date: 3 December 2025 Time: 3.30pm – 5pm | Location: Bank of England / Hybrid Minutes Item 1. Introduction & Minutes of last meeting The Co-Chair welcomed the Committee to this hybrid meeting and noted that the minutes of the last UK Money Market Code Sub-Committee meeting (held on 3 June 2025) is on the Bank’s website. Item 2. An Update for the UK Money Market Sub-Code Committee The Code Sub-Committee secretariat noted that the updated UK Money Market Code (“Code”) has been formally re-recognised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as an industry standard for a period of three years i.e. until 3 November 2028. Following this news, the Bank published a Press Notice . The secretariat also noted that 30 firms had re-attested to the Code since it was updated. The Committee suggested promoting the Code via social media (in addition to the other avenues used in the past) to reach a wider audience in a bid to get more firms to re-attest to the updated Code. The secretariat will explore potential options. Item 3: DBV for Bank of England’s Short Term Repo (STR) Facility: An update EUI is planning to change the allocation method for DBV from selecting bonds with the highest value in a member’s portfolio to selecting the bonds which attract the lowest haircut, first. The plan is to implement this change in EUI’s April 2026 release. This change supports the feedback received from the market following the Bank’s Discussion Paper, ‘ Transitioning to a repo-led framework’ , which was published in December 2024. Market consensus suggests that being able to use DBV (which allows for DvP settlement) will help reduce operational frictions. Against the backdrop of increased usage of the STR, the Committee agreed that this change will encourage the market to use DBV for the STR and thus benefit from some of the operational efficiencies of DBV. Item 4: EUI Transformation Project: An update Committee members were given an update by Euroclear on the CREST Transformation project which aims to modernise Crest’s infrastructure. CREST will be increasing its engagement with the market in 2026. On the collateral stream of the project, CREST have done their proof of concept for the Tri-Party within EUI and will be holding another workshop in 2026. This work aims to move from Euroclear’s DBV product to Tri-party (EUI-Triparty) and establish a Collateral Management System (CMS) which will conduct the auto selecting of collateral rather than DBV. The timeline for collateral stream is end of 2028. The new CREST web GUI is now live with the early adopters actively using it. This will be rolled out to all users throughout 2026. The position and settlement stream of the project is under development and ongoing. CREST is currently engaging with the market with regards to the likely design and key protocols associated with the new settlement system. CREST will be providing an update on the project at the next meeting. Item 5.

It should be noted, however, that as these cannot be observed as objective data, they have to be estimated by some means. The Bank of Japan's Research and Statistics Department prepares these data on a regular basis for assessing the state of Japan's economic activity and prices, and it also releases the estimation results on the Bank's website on a quarterly basis. These estimates are, in principle, released on the third business day in January, April, July, and October. For estimation methods, see the following paper: Kawamoto et al. ""Methodology for Estimating Output Gap and Potential Growth Rate: An Update,"" Bank of Japan Research Paper, May 2017. Please keep in mind that the data need to be viewed with some latitude as the output gap and potential growth rate estimates may differ considerably depending on the estimation methods and also as they are subject to estimation errors.

While its principles still apply, its implementation has evolved over the years, reflecting changes in the business, technology and risk landscape.","Implementation of the Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting (BCBS 239 Principles) This version This newsletter summarises key themes and challenges related to banks' risk data aggregation and risk reporting practices (RDA) based on recent supervisory and industry outreach sessions on BCBS 239 principles implementation. The Committee believes the information provided may be useful for both supervisors and banks in their day-to-day activities. This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute new supervisory guidance or expectations. Key takeaways on current issues and challenges Accurate, comprehensive and timely data aggregation and reporting capabilities are critical for identifying and managing material risks that could result in financial losses, impacting the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The BCBS 239 principles provide a strong framework for bank data and risk management practices, initially targeting systemically important banks (SIBs) and applicable both at the banking group level and on a subsidiary level. Some banks have chosen to include risk data aggregation (RDA) in broader enterprise-wide data governance frameworks to support their various initiatives related to data governance and management. The Basel Committee remains committed to fostering dialogue between supervisors and the industry to address ongoing challenges and advance the effective implementation of BCBS 239. Recent industry outreach sessions included information-sharing on current issues and challenges related to banks' data management and risk management practices, including: (i) the continuous need for banks to adapt to evolving business environments, technological advancements and changes in the risk landscape; (ii) governance of RDA activities; (iii) data lineage; (iv) cross-border issues; and (v) RDA implications from leveraging emerging technology and compensating controls. Adapting to a changing operating environment Since its publication in 2013, BCBS 239 has become a foundational framework for data management and risk management practices in the banking sector. While its principles still apply, its implementation has evolved over the years, reflecting changes in the business, technology and risk landscape. For instance, changes in the business environment, such as mergers and acquisitions or the introduction of new products, often involve adjustments to risk data aggregation and reporting practices. At the same time, technological advancements offer new opportunities but also introduce additional complexity and dimensions of risk. Despite progress, meeting the intended outcomes of the Principles remains a continuous effort due to the complexity of implementation and advancements in broader operational and business transformations. To ensure that practices remain current and appropriate, some banks find it helpful to conduct periodic assessments of in-scope data to observe alignment with the principles. Supervisors, in turn, often evaluate practices across institutions and incorporate feedback from supervised institutions to track progress, identify common themes or challenges and provide clarity about supervisory assessment. Governance and data Bank boards have the responsibility for broad oversight of RDA activities within their banks. This includes gaining assurance from management that processes are sound and ensuring that board members receive appropriate information on RDA. Boards must also remain aware of significant problems or shortcomings that could result in material risks that could lead to financial losses, potentially impacting the safety and soundness of the bank. Management, on the other hand, has the responsibility for day-to-day RDA activities and for keeping the board informed of key developments. Outreach participants highlighted that a strong data-driven culture and active involvement of senior management are beneficial for overcoming implementation barriers and preserving bank capabilities. While BCBS 239 has elevated data governance to the board level, a data-driven culture within some organisations remains a work in progress. Resistance to change, fragmented responsibilities and insufficient attention from senior management continue to hinder progress at certain banks. Some banks have applied the principles from BCBS 239 to include broader enterprise-wide data governance frameworks. This evolution reflects the growing recognition of data as a strategic asset that supports regulatory reporting, finance, analytics as well as business activities and can differ depending on a financial institution's size, complexity and risk profile. While this broader application can increase complexity and may involve additional investments in governance, technology and personnel, it may offer opportunities to rationalise systems, remove silos, reduce costs and improve data quality across domains. Sustained board-level buy-in, alignment with business and risk objectives, clear governance frameworks, and investments in data literacy (the ability to interpret and use data to inform decisions) were emphasised by industry participants as important contributors to effective governance and, in turn, enhanced data aggregation capabilities. These elements can deliver broader organisational benefits, such as enhanced data quality and operational efficiency. Addressing data challenges Data lineage, or the traceability of data from its origin to its final use, is important for confirming data quality. This remains a challenging component of BCBS 239 for banks. Legacy systems, distributed data estates and the dynamic nature of data lineage complicate banks' efforts to confirm end-to-end data traceability. Finding appropriate vendor solutions and the resource-intensive nature of identifying and maintaining data lineage can further hinder progress. However, demonstrating the business benefits of data lineage, such as cost reduction and improved efficiency, can help secure investment in automated tools. The ability to produce timely, accurate and complete ad-hoc reports remains a significant hurdle for some banks, particularly during crises or in response to regulatory requests in light of an emerging risk. Balancing manual and automated processes across fragmented data estates is resource-intensive but contributes to effective risk data aggregation. Conducting ad hoc reports during good times to test risk data aggregation capabilities can help banks prepare for distributing such reports during times of stress, when access to this information is crucial to decision-making. Cross-border implementation Internationally active banks face particular challenges in aligning data management practices across subsidiaries and local affiliates in various countries. Banks with more complex structures, including various subsidiaries or international operations, may face particular challenges associated with aggregating data at the individual entity level and then up to the consolidated parent. Decentralised IT or other systems that could hamper RDA may also present hurdles. Industry participants have highlighted the complexity of aligning with principles, expectations and in some cases requirements in different jurisdictions. In response, banks may choose to establish standardised group-level practices that address circumstances in various jurisdictions, applying them consistently across affiliates. Leveraging emerging technologies and compensating controls Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced automation, hold promise for improving risk data aggregation capabilities. However, their adoption is still in the early stages. As the quality of AI-driven outputs depends on high-quality data, robust data management becomes more important for effective implementation. Banks may benefit from carefully considering whether to apply compensating controls to address identified issues in their risk aggregation practices. These controls can take several different forms and function best when they are risk-based – the general principle being to apply more caution and care to risk data output when there are known shortcomings in data aggregation processes. The Basel Committee remains committed to fostering continual dialogue between supervisors and the industry to address ongoing challenges and advance the effective implementation of BCBS 239.",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Honorable Governors, dear colleagues, and distinguished guests. I would like to start by thanking you for joining us in this summit and for your valuable active participation. This summit went beyond discussing a shared vision for financial transformation in our region - it helps shape it to achieve a digital future that is inclusive, resilient, and grounded in trust. Our dialogue and experience sharing are what make this summit a success. As we conclude the SAMA-BIS Innovation Summit here in Riyadh, I am honored to have the opportunity to highlight some of the insights that have surfaced over the last two days. We gathered here with a common objective, which is to understand how innovation can serve our people, strengthen financial integrity, and empower our region to lead responsibly. Innovation in finance is a collective endeavor shaped by regulators, technologists, academics, and industry leaders working side by side, and it is significant when it solves real-world problems and adds real value to the stakeholders. Therefore, it is critical to listen to the market, clients, corporate, retail, and SMEs, and understand needs and challenges, while working towards addressing these needs in a safe and stable financial environment. Across sessions, a unifying theme emerged: The need to build an ecosystem that is open, interoperable, and resilient. This new financial architecture must be built on 'trust by design,' and this trust should not be considered a byproduct of innovation; it should serve as its foundation. The implication is that our systems must be secure, explainable, and inclusive – whether in tokenizing money, developing and deploying AI, or preparing for the Quantum disruption. Day One: Cross-Border Payments Our summit began yesterday with a focus on the role of central banks in fostering innovation and cross-border collaboration. Keynote addresses by His Excellency SAMA Governor Mr. Ayman M. Al-Sayari and Mr. Pablo Hernández de Cos reminded us that innovation must preserve and enhance stability, resilience, and trust. Leaders from regional central banks and beyond then reflected on the G20 roadmap, highlighting the urgency of building payment systems that are faster, cheaper, transparent, and inclusive. The message was clear: regional leadership is essential to global progress. In the BIS Innovation Hub's Agora Project, we saw a fascinating showcase of how tokenization and smart contracts can reshape wholesale cross-border settlements. We then transitioned to a discussion about the design principles of tokenized money and payments to ensure that digital value transfer is secure. The Machine-Readable Rulebook project, presented by SAMA's Innovation Hub, was a demonstration of how AI models can be used to annotate obligations according to a predefined taxonomy and transform them into a machine-readable format. This enables benefits such as systematically comparing similar regulatory obligations across jurisdictions and identifying areas of potential over- or under-regulation. As we wrapped up the first day, we explored how AI can enhance cross-border payments by making them faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive. We also examined practical safeguards that can be implemented to ensure that AI-generated payment decisions are sound while minimizing potential errors and biases. Day Two: Mitigating Emerging Technology Risks Today, discussions shifted from possibilities to responsibilities when Dr. Rashad Cassim's keynote reminded us of the risks that accompany innovation, and that cybersecurity, misinformation, and divergent systems are central to the future of finance. We heard from the South African Reserve Bank and the BIS Innovation Hub in Hong Kong, highlighting how challenge-based collaboration can unlock scalable solutions. Whether through digital identity or data portability, the emphasis continues to be on building systems that are inclusive by design. The critical need for standards and interoperability was stressed in a fireside chat, noting that without a common language, even the most advanced systems risk becoming silos and limiting their potential. The vital need for interoperability resurfaced in discussions around ""Scaling Tokenization Safely"", in addition to the importance of legal frameworks and operational resilience. We were reminded that the most dangerous risks are often the quietest ones, including AI drift, hallucination, and subtle inaccuracies. These challenges demand continuous monitoring and prudent design. This guided us into discussions about ""Governance by Design"", and the need to embed accountability and transparency within AI from the beginning. This is a moral imperative, not a technical one. Mr. Wolfgang Engel, Mr. Azam Alameddin, and I spoke about a subject of particular interest to me, regarding the evolving role of central banks in facilitating innovation, and recognizing that their roles require more proactive 'seeding' as opposed to a more traditional approach of reactive oversight. In this context, we shared the example of SAMA's internal Fintech Application Assessment Tool. While the shift from closed proprietary architecture towards modular systems in the financial system is lauded for its many benefits, we heard about the new risks that this approach gives rise to and how risk management needs to evolve in response. Last but not least, we discussed the potential threat from Quantum computing, and the transformative power and risks of which may not be as distant as some believe. Our colleagues discussed the strategic role of central banks in anticipating risks, and how a clear strategy for developing Quantum-safe cryptography and cross-sector collaboration is needed. I recognize that this summit has given us all a lot to digest. Therefore, I would like to highlight three notable takeaway points: Institutionalizing Innovation: Central banks must embed innovation into their structures, from dedicated innovation hubs and sandbox programs to clear, structured approaches, and international collaboration and partnership. Strengthening Regional Interoperability: Repeatedly, expert speakers and practitioners have stressed the importance of regional coordination. Projects such as Agora and future tokenization pilots can lay the foundations for a truly interoperable financial network across our region. However, we must do our part to connect across jurisdictions to join the dots. Building Resilience on a Forward-Looking Basis: AI drift, cyber vulnerabilities, and quantum disruption are risks that demand proactive governance. We must invest in forward-looking approaches to testing, experimentation, and shared frameworks. I firmly believe that the collaboration between SAMA and the BIS Innovation Hub provides a model approach that we hope even more of our peers will choose to adopt. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to extend our gratitude to: His Excellency SAMA Governor, Mr. Ayman M. Al-Sayari, for his visionary leadership, and to Mr. Pablo Hernández de Cos for cross-collaboration throughout BIS. The governors, deputy governors, and heads of innovation centers for their deep insights and valuable contributions. The Moderators and speakers for their thought-provoking comments and dialogues. The BIS Innovation Hub for their enthusiastic support and leadership at this Summit and in our many bilateral engagements. All the staff and team members who work behind the scenes, backstage, and at the registration desks for all your hard work. Thank you. Thank you to all the participants and delegates for your time, energy, and commitment to our shared goals. On behalf of the Saudi Central Bank, and in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, I thank you all for your active participation. We look forward to welcoming you again to Saudi Arabia in the near future. Thank you, and wish you a wonderful experience for the rest of your stay in Riyadh and a safe trip back home.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good afternoon. It is with great pleasure that I welcome you all to the first SAMA-BIS Regional Innovation Summit here in Riyadh - a city that has emerged as a hub for market-leading innovation in financial services. Hosting this summit, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, is a testament to our growing role in helping shape the future of financial innovation - not only within our region but also on the global stage. This summit demonstrates our commitment to collective learning, pioneering, and collaboration in an era of rapid technological evolution. Over the course of this summit, you will hear from global thought leaders about emerging technologies that are facilitating, disrupting, and reshaping our world. You will also hear from regulators about how we strive to maintain stability, foster collaboration, and manage the impact of novel technologies in order to counter uncertainty and ambiguity. This year's summit focuses on two themes: the first is cross-border payments, where we shed light on the wide array of innovation opportunities it offers. The second theme centers on the risks and mitigants of emerging technologies that are rapidly reshaping entire segments of the economy, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), and Quantum computing. Context: A Rare Opportunity Allow me to frame these conversations in the context of the rare opportunity that I believe we are presented with at this juncture. It is the opportunity to lay the foundations for a future financial infrastructure that is truly transformative in speed, resilience, and inclusivity. As was the case with the infrastructure we have inherited, the new foundations we lay today will be the building blocks for future development and innovation. However, seizing this opportunity will require concerted efforts to facilitate innovation and effective collaboration to create favorable circumstances for long-term success. Innovation plays a key role in how we deliver our mandate. To remain effective in the face of technological change, we must fully understand these innovations in order to leverage their benefits while also proactively identifying and mitigating associated risks. Innovation empowers us to anticipate, respond with agility, and build a more resilient and robust financial ecosystem. Innovation is also a shared responsibility - driven by collaboration, openness, and a commitment to public value. It thrives through collective effort and thoughtful engagement. Prudent approaches to innovation balance ambition with accountability. When guided by purpose, it has the power to shape systems that are smarter, more inclusive, and built to endure. The Regional Advantage As we explore the future of financial innovation, it is essential to recognize that the journey toward digital transformation will be shaped by the distinct challenges faced in each market, which might differ from those faced elsewhere. Across the Middle East and Africa region, new technology frameworks are advancing, yet their adoption is often constrained by structural, regulatory, and geopolitical complexities. To truly harness these technologies, we must build resilient ecosystems that reflect our region's unique context. This means investing in human capital, developing regulatory agility, and promoting cross-border collaboration. Our regional economies have a rare window of opportunity to accelerate growth and innovation over the coming years, supported by high digital adoption rates, strong investment in payments infrastructure, and young tech-savvy populations. Financial systems in the region also carry less legacy infrastructure and less fragmentation, at both system and individual firm levels, compared to other economies, offering a further advantage. The Unique Strengths of Saudi Arabia Our own efforts in Saudi Arabia are guided by the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030, outlining an ambitious journey of economic transformation. A key pillar of Saudi Vision 2030 is to develop a thriving and innovative financial services sector in the Kingdom by strengthening existing financial institutions, driving greater innovation, and ultimately cementing Saudi Arabia's position as a leader in financial innovation, whilst maintaining the stability of the financial sector. This ongoing transformation has been enabled by robust digital infrastructure, progressive regulation, and strong collaboration between SAMA and the market, with the objective of achieving global competitiveness and establishing Saudi Arabia as a fintech hub where technology-based innovation in financial services can serve as the foundation for enhancing economic empowerment. At SAMA, we facilitate this transformation through a number of initiatives that are derived from our institutional strategy, including the prudent adoption of new technologies tested in our Regulatory Sandbox, such as digital financing, savings, open banking, and peer-to-peer lending. Our dedicated Innovation Hub conducts a range of technology exploration, development, and prototyping relevant to the role and operations of a central bank and financial markets. These efforts have helped explore how emerging technologies can support and enhance our core functions in Monetary Policy, Financial Stability, and Supervision. Through our Hub, we have delivered proofs of concept that demonstrate real-world utility and strategic value, often working closely with the private sector. Examples include: The Collateral Asset Management Project, which successfully leveraged blockchain technology to automate the pledging of collateral. The Tokenized Deposits Project, which tested both account-based and token-based models of tokenized commercial bank money on a live, multi-party blockchain network. Several AI-based tools and prototypes, including an automation tool to support our FinTech team in streamlining the end-to-end analysis and processing of applications, which shrunk application processing times by over 95%. A prototype machine-readable rulebook based on SAMA's regulations, which employed AI-based annotation and processing of various jurisdictions' regulatory text, thus enabling SAMA Supervision teams to review and analyze specific regulatory content across jurisdictions. In addition to these in-house efforts, our Innovation Hub also spearheads our global outreach in innovation through joint projects with other central banks, standard-setting bodies, and think tanks. This includes our collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub on several projects, including Project Rio, Pyxtrial, Promissa, and Insight. Way Forward As central banks, we must strive to work more closely across borders; coordinate and align our approaches towards adopting new technologies, infrastructure, and explore harmonized standards. Innovation will thrive if the road we pave across borders is free of barriers. We must strive to share knowledge, understanding the unique challenges faced in our region and across jurisdictions, and together explore the solutions that show the most promise. When we look beyond our individual priorities and consider the region as a whole, we will innovate at scale. I expect that this will surface fascinating challenges to resolve. However, I believe, and fully anticipate, that the solutions borne out of cross-border efforts at a regional scale will trump any that we can formulate in isolation, and the benefits will be more sustainable. In the absence of consistent frameworks and shared standards, global progress risks becoming fragmented and uneven across markets, or even perhaps coming undone in the face of cross-jurisdictional frictions and operational vulnerabilities if markets engage in regulatory arbitrage. Through collaboration and armed with policy expertise, capital, and talent, we can instead seize this opportunity to leapfrog legacy constraints and build the infrastructure of the future. Central banks and regulators in the region, far from being mere gatekeepers, can thus become catalysts and stewards of innovation for the collective benefit of our economies. I will conclude my remarks by encouraging you all to actively participate in these proceedings, get to know your fellow delegates, and both contribute to and challenge our collective thinking as we forge the path ahead. Thank you. Related information More speeches from ""Saudi Central Bank"" Country page: Saudi Arabia",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Introduction Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to another Bank of Jamaica Quarterly Monetary Policy Report press conference. The Jamaican society and economy have been severely impacted by Hurricane Melissa. Latest estimates indicate that the damage to critical infrastructure – including roads, houses, factories, schools, other buildings, the electricity grid and other public and private assets – amounts to approximately US$8.8 billion, or more than 40 per cent of GDP. This is a significant upward revision from the previous initial estimate of 30 per cent. The agriculture sector has been particularly devasted, with damage estimated at approximately US$389 million. Given agriculture's central role in food supply and livelihoods, this loss has far-reaching implications for prices, incomes and overall economic activity. The Tourism sector, particularly properties in western parishes, also sustained significant damage, with 43 per cent of room stock closed immediately after the storm. While some less-affected properties have since reopened and resumed bookings, widespread cancellations and delayed reopening by major hotel chains will reduce tourism earnings in the near term. Already, we have received reports indicating worker lay-offs. Importantly, the upward revision of the damage estimate creates a greater risk that higher inflation could be prolonged. Beyond the immediate impact on agricultural food and electricity prices, the later effect of this inflation shock on the prices of other goods and services, is likely to be stronger and more persistent than initially anticipated. As a result, the upside risk of the disaster on the inflation outlook is greater, meaning that inflation could be higher than forecast. Monetary Policy Decision It is in this context and given the Bank's primary mandate of managing inflation that the MPC decided unanimously to: (i) continue holding the policy rate at 5.75 per cent per annum; and (ii) remain proactive in preserving relative stability in the foreign exchange market. The decision to continue holding the policy rate at this time is largely based on four main factors: First, annual headline inflation will rise sharply over the next few months from the 4.4 per cent recorded in November 2025, and will exceed the Bank's inflation target range of 4.0 to 6.0 per cent by early 2026. This rise primarily reflects the hurricane's impact on the major food-producing parishes and disruptions to supply chains, particularly in energy and agriculture. These supply-side shocks lie outside the direct influence of monetary policy and therefore cannot be addressed through interest rate actions, but will have a knock-on effect on other prices. The second factor concerns core Inflation. Core inflation (which excludes the prices of agricultural food items and fuel from the consumer price index (CPI)) will also rise over the next 12 months breaching the inflation target range in early 2026. This will reflect another wave of price increases for other goods and services such as home repairs, meals sold at restaurants and personal care items. The higher core inflation will arise in the context of the anticipated surge in overall spending and economic activities related to recovery and the rebuilding efforts, supported largely by flows of external financing to the private and public sectors. The central bank is therefore positioning monetary policy to minimise such second-round effects and to constrain the inflation expectations of businesses and consumers. The third factor that figured prominently in the decision to hold the policy rate unchanged at this time, is the path for the fiscal or government accounts. In the aftermath of the hurricane, the government suspended the fiscal rule for an initial period of one year. This will facilitate the public sector's ability to increase spending for the recovery and relief effort. For the central government, in particular, larger fiscal deficits are projected over the next three fiscal years, compared with previous projections. While the additional government spending is absolutely essential to rebuild the foundations of the economy following such a catastrophic event as Hurricane Melissa, the Bank has to position its policy to temper any possible inflationary impulses from this increased spending. The fourth factor which the MPC considered is that the risks to the inflation outlook are skewed strongly to the upside. This means that there is a greater likelihood of inflation exceeding projections. Higher inflation could result from higher-than-expected demand to support the reconstruction efforts. Inflation expectations could also rise, as households and firms anticipate higher prices and adjust their behaviour in ways that make higher inflation self-fulfilling. A more protracted recovery in the agriculture sector and more prolonged disruptions to its supply chains could also worsen food price increases. There could also be long-term damage in specific industries, which could slow the improvement in the production and availability of supplies. In our previous press release in November, we noted that special pre-emptive measures would be taken to preserve relative stability in the foreign exchange market. These measures took into consideration the need for additional foreign exchange to finance increased imports made necessary by the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. Consequently, since the passage of the hurricane, Bank of Jamaica has sold US$250 million into the market. We have also directly supplied the foreign exchange needs of selected players in the energy sector to take large lumpy purchases out of the market, as well as re-introduced scheduled advanced notices of intervention sales in order to assure the market of adequate foreign currency liquidity. With these actions, the exchange rate has remained stable over the period 01 November to 16 December 2025 compared to end-October 2025. Cumulatively, BOJ sold US$1.1 billion via its B-FXITT facility over the 12 months to end-November 2025, largely in line with the amount sold over the 12 months to end-November 2024. Net foreign exchange purchases have amounted to approximately US$1.0 billion over the 12 months to end-November 2025. Going forward, the Bank will continue to proactively take steps to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market as instability in this market can fuel higher prices throughout the economy. I will now briefly highlight some recent economic developments, starting with the most recent inflation data. Recent Economic Developments On the 15th of December, the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) reported that headline inflation at November 2025 was 4.4 per cent, which was above the Bank's projections and higher than the 2.9 per cent recorded at October 2025. The higher inflation compared with October was due mainly to higher food price increases, reflecting early signs of the impact of the hurricane on raw food prices. Core inflation was 4.3 per cent at November 2025, which was above the 3.7 per cent recorded at October 2025. Inflation is projected to rise above the Bank's target range over the next four quarters, peaking in the June 2026 quarter and, as supply conditions improve along with the appropriate monetary policy response, will moderate back to the target range in early 2027. The near-term macroeconomic outlook for the Jamaican economy has been adversely affected by Hurricane Melissa. The PIOJ estimates that the economy will contract in the range of 11 to 13 per cent in the December 2025 quarter. While economic activity will contract in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, the Bank projects that the funding inflows from multilateral and private sources will support spending in the economy over the next three years, to the extent that the capacity exists to execute planned projects. For the Financial Year 2025/26, the Bank anticipates a decline in real GDP in the range of minus four (-4.0) to minus six (-6.0) per cent, largely due to the extensive damage to infrastructure and disruption to productive activity. For Financial Year 2026/27, real GDP growth is projected in the range of minus one (-1.0) to one (1.0) per cent, reflecting the start of recovery efforts, which will pick up pace in ensuing years. Jamaica's external accounts are also expected to deteriorate over the near-term. The current account is expected to worsen to a deficit, a major change from the surpluses recorded over the three prior fiscal years. The projected deficit will result primarily from a worsening in the trade deficit, and lower tourism inflows, partly offset by higher remittances. In particular, exports are projected to be lower on average primarily due to the projected falloff in Manufacturing, Mining and Quarrying, Agriculture and Re-exports. Imports, on the other hand, are projected to be higher on average, underpinned by higher consumer goods as well as greater demand for raw materials, transport equipment and capital goods imports. The increase in the importation of transport equipment and capital goods is related to the ongoing relief efforts and to support reconstruction thereafter. Notwithstanding the worsened external position, Jamaica's international reserves remain robust, standing at a historically high level of US$6.3 billion at 16 December 2025, representing about 151 per cent of the measure considered adequate. These reserves will be buoyed by the various disaster risk financing, multilateral funding and grant flows, including the receipt of the proceeds related to the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the Catastrophe Bond. Concluding Statement Ladies and gentlemen, the extensive damage from Hurricane Melissa, particularly in Western Jamaica, is expected to adversely impact the country's key macroeconomic indicators for quite some time. Against this stark backdrop, BOJ's Monetary Policy Committee reaffirms its view that preserving a stable macroeconomic environment is essential to the country's recovery and reconstruction efforts. The Bank remains firmly committed to managing the inflationary effects of the hurricane, recognizing that if inflation is not tamed, every sector of the Jamaican society will be adversely impacted especially the poor and most vulnerable. Accordingly, the MPC will continue to keenly monitor the future impact of higher food prices on the level of overall inflation, and stands ready to adjust monetary policy if the risks highlighted earlier threaten the projected return of inflation to the 4 to 6 per cent target range in the shortest possible timeframe. Thank you. I will now take questions. Related information More speeches from ""Bank of Jamaica"" Country page: Jamaica",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good morning, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the attendance of the Minister for Economy, Trade and Business and of the Vice-Chair of the CNMV, as well as of the representatives of the business associations with us here today. This event is taking place as part of a shared reflection on how to improve our SMEs' access to financing, an objective that we at the Banco de España view as a priority. SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy. They constitute more than 99% of all firms and account for about two-thirds of employment and gross value added. These figures – higher than the European average – reflect SMEs' profound importance as a driver of economic activity in our country. In recent years, Spanish companies have strengthened their balance sheets. They have lowered their debt, increased their equity and bolstered their financial resilience, reducing their vulnerability to future shocks. This may, however, also pose a dilemma: less debt means less vulnerability, but it may also limit investment capacity, adversely affecting businesses' growth and productivity. Consequently, moderate leveraging may be beneficial for promoting expansion projects. The challenge is therefore to find the right level of indebtedness so as to combine financial soundness with economic efficiency. Bank lending continues to be the main external source of interest-bearing financing for SMEs, although it has decreased considerably relative to gross value added since the financial crisis. For their part, microenterprises resort even less to bank credit and more to self-financing. Importantly, this reduction in borrowing does not result from a supply-side problem. According to the ECB survey on the access to finance, since 2024 credit availability has improved significantly, while demand remains at historically low levels. Still, some segments face greater difficulties in gaining access to bank lending, especially firms without prior bank debt and microenterprises. In many cases, insufficient financial information or the administrative costs associated with small loans may discourage such lending. And in contexts of uncertainty, these barriers tend to be more evident. To continue to improve, we must work to reduce these information asymmetries and find ways to facilitate these firms' access to bank financing. Of the instruments that can boost this access, two are particularly relevant. The first are independent ratings. At the Banco de España we are working to address this issue, broadening the use of independent ratings through the in-house credit assessment system, or ICAS. This tool makes it possible to assess firms' creditworthiness with consistent and transparent criteria. Having this type of rating can open up new opportunities, by improving the negotiating position with banks, facilitating access to public financing programmes, increasing visibility to investors and narrowing the information gap that often penalises the smallest firms. The second instrument with a great deal of potential is loan securitisation. This is an effective tool for transforming credit portfolios into liquidity, transferring risk and freeing up capital that can be used for new loans. Nevertheless, its role in Spain remains limited. The volume of securitisations is below the EU average, and far below the level seen in the United States. Moreover, SMEs account for merely 7.3% of all loan securitisations in Spain, compared with 15.9% in the euro area, even though SMEs represent a much higher share of our economy. These figures underscore that there is much room for growth. The European Commission's recent proposal to revise the regulatory framework for securitisations is a step in the right direction, but it will be necessary to accompany it with complementary initiatives that spur the growth of a truly pan-European product that is attractive to investors and accessible to a larger number of institutions. Hence, the minister's proposal to explore, within the framework of the European Competitiveness Lab, a European platform for securitisations may be a decisive step forward. Beyond bank credit, SMEs need to diversify their sources of financing. Not only for efficiency, but also for resilience to possible credit constraints and adaptation to the different stages of development of credit. For instance, venture capital is key for companies with high growth potential, such as startups and scaleups, that require flexible resources to scale up their projects. We know that there is a direct relationship between venture capital and investment in R&D, which underscores its role as a driver of innovation and productivity. The evidence shows that enterprises that are financed with venture capital have significantly higher job growth than those that are not. Nevertheless, not only should this boost come from venture capital; it should also be backed by bank lending, which can complement it. Recent Banco de España studies show that when a company receives a venture capital investment, its access to bank credit also improves, because the information asymmetry is narrowed. Nevertheless, the volume of this type of transactions in Spain remains low – 0.14% of GDP, versus 0.22% in the euro area and 0.74% in the United States – highlighting the opportunities that still exist in this area. In sum, SMEs with the most growth potential need a varied, stable and flexible financial ecosystem in which bank and non-bank financing are complementary. It is for this reason that I am pleased to announce today that we are creating a High-Level Task Force on SME Financing and fostering a European securitisation platform, jointly promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Business, the Banco de España and the CNMV, with the participation of public institutions, business associations and representatives of the financial system. This task force will prepare an updated assessment of SMEs' access to financing and draw up specific proposals to promote the growth of such financing. The task force will, inter alia, draft a proposal spelling out the configuration of a European securitisation platform, which will be framed as a contribution as part of the work of the European Competitiveness Lab. Spain has an active role to play in this process. Our financial system has demonstrated its soundness and adaptability, and we have a significant savings base and an innovative business fabric which, under the right conditions, is positioned to take full advantage of the growth opportunities offered by new financing channels. It is my hope that today's remarks and discussions will help enrich this reflection and define specific steps in an agenda that concerns all of us. Thank you.

Introduction It is a great honor to have this opportunity to address such a distinguished gathering of business leaders in Japan today. 2026 is now just a week away. Looking back over the past twelve months, Japan's economy has shown resilience, having continued to recover moderately despite downward pressure on corporate profits stemming from the impact of U.S. tariff policies. Against this backdrop, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held last week, the Bank of Japan decided to raise the policy interest rate for the first time since January this year. In this regard, I would like to begin my speech today by briefly explaining the background to the policy change. I would then like to share with you an outline of the state of the economy the Bank is aiming for and, on that basis, set out my hopes for business leaders in Japan.

Slides accompanying the speech My speech today will focus on two trends that characterise the international payments market and what they mean for us in Sweden and Europe. The first trend is that the payments market is still undergoing considerable change through digitalisation. This leads to reduced distances, global businesses and an expectation by all of us that t goods and services from the rest of the world should be a tap of a keyboard or a mobile phone screen away. The second trend is that the world is experiencing increased geopolitical tensions, polarisation and fragmentation, which may have major implications for the payments market as well. Digitalisation and our dependence on international technology services make us vulnerable to developments in the world around us, and we should worry about what happens if we suddenly lack connectivity or access to electricity. Given the global nature of these trends, all central banks are essentially facing the same questions about how best to meet the challenges and harness the potential of digitalisation. Firstly, there is the question of how we view the money we issue – what form should it take, who should have access to it and how should it be used?

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good morning and welcome to the Central Bank of Ireland. Thank you for joining us for our annual festive gathering of the Irish economics community. It is a pleasure to have you with us and to take stock of the year that has passed. Indeed, as I reflect on the year behind us – and as I set out in a blog I'm publishing this morning – my report card for the Irish and euro area economies might read as follows: a good year, in the face of significant geopolitical and geoeconomic upheaval, and, for now, performing around potential. Of course, in classic report card fashion, that only tells part of the story, and it certainly underplays what feels like a tumultuous year for the global economy as old paradigms disappear and new challenges emerge. Changes in the global distribution of power, of military strength and of strategic influence have been upending the world that we have become familiar with, a world founded on principles of openness, cooperation and integration that have underpinned the international order for the last 35 – if not 80 – years. The upending did not start this year but 2025 feels like a step-change. Geoeconomic fragmentation is not only a financial development with deep implications for a small open economy such as Ireland but also the economic manifestation of a profound political current that resists interdependence, that privileges national over collective reasoning, and that often substitutes conviction for evidence. Social media, with its adeptness at triggering emotions, is accelerating that political current. In many parts of the world, we see the rise of political movements that question the value of economic expertise, and the legitimacy of science itself as a guide for policymaking. For central banks as well as for policymakers, and for institutions of knowledge, this tide is a profound challenge. It reminds us that economic policymaking does not exist in isolation: it is embedded in societies, in their political narratives, and in their trust in expertise. And when that trust erodes, the ability to design and implement coherent, long-term policy weakens in turn. In this environment, the contribution of independent analytical institutions serves both as a stabilising force in the public debate and as a channel to enable good judgment, to allow for decision without ideology or, indeed, emotion. That is why I am extremely proud of the contribution made by the Central Bank's people to both in-house research but also in collaboration with colleagues outside of the Bank, and as reflected in the Research Bulletin (PDF 618.04KB) we published yesterday. As the global landscape evolves, it will be essential to sustain our ability to allow and promote deep and diverse analysis and thinking, as well as dialogue across disciplines, sectors, and borders. Today's workshop Today's programme promises a fascinating array of presentations and discussions, addressing some of the most pressing issues at the forefront of our work here in the Central Bank. Let me first turn to how our research enables us to respond to the challenges of the day, in such a complex and fast-moving environment. We see research, both in its output but more importantly in the capacity that it builds within our people and our teams, as an essential component of our work. It ensures that our policy decisions and advice, whether that be on domestic macroprudential measures, in contribution to the ECB's monetary policy decisions, or on the growth prospects and resilience of the Irish economy, are made using a timely, relevant and credible evidence base. Let me take a moment to briefly highlight some of our major research achievements, first in informing our own policy decisions, and second in informing our economic policy advice. The importance of research for our policy positions has been especially visible in 2025 in the body of extensive work published on the mortgage measures. These pieces, ranging from in-depth Research Technical Papers, to accessible, descriptive pieces in our Staff Insights series, have provided rich perspectives on the way in which our recalibration of the mortgage measures – in operation since the start of 2023 – is impacting borrowers, credit standards, and housing transactions. This research agenda is also helping us understand the relative weight of the costs and benefits of our policy actions, as well as potential spillover channels and unintended consequences. Our commitment to devoting significant analytical resources to understanding the impact of our policy actions remains steadfast; we see the evaluation of policy impact as a requirement for good policymaking, and something that must be refreshed and enhanced regularly. To serve our major stakeholders, the Irish public, faithfully, we must ensure that the full range of impact channels, particularly of major interventions such as the mortgage measures, are well understood, and well communicated. Vas Madouros' address to the Dublin Economics Workshop in September, reflecting on ten years' experience with the mortgage measures, is an example of this commitment in operation. Our research also underpins our economic policy advice. My annual pre-Budget letter to the Minister for Finance, published in June this year and outlining our views on the trajectory of fiscal policy, is supported by a wealth of fiscal and macroeconomic modelling and projection exercises. It is also closely informed by our ongoing work on long-term growth prospects for the Irish economy, which has seen our teams conducting deep dives on demographic issues and continues with work on Artificial Intelligence and the labour market, among others. One of our headline policy contributions this year was our Signed Article published in September by our Firms and Productivity Working Group, on the exposure of the Irish economy to the ongoing threat of geoeconomic fragmentation and US tariff policy. This was a textbook example of how rigorous, technically complex research can be synthesised to serve the needs of a policymaking institution. The article drew insights from macroeconomic models, micro analysis of administrative data, and featured analysis done in collaboration with one of our Visiting Scholars. Bringing together these diverse methods, our work drew holistic conclusions on the likely impact, and major sources of impact, across the Irish economy both in the short-run and long-run. The work has formed the foundation of a number of key interventions by myself and my colleagues in the public policy debate in recent months, highlighting the important finding that, despite some sectoral challenges, the economy is well-positioned to absorb tariffs as currently implemented by the US administration. Our contributions to the euro area monetary policy agenda remain of course a key priority. This year alone, our researchers have published working papers on trend inflation, the natural rate of interest, the effect of monetary policy across the wealth distribution, house price expectation formation, the role of loan contract features in determining interest rates pass-through, the differential pass-through of policy rates to loan rates by non-bank lenders, and capital misallocation in Europe. This work, and more, informs our interventions on the major policy issues facing the Governing Council. Looking Ahead Looking ahead to 2026, our research and economic policy advice will continue to be influenced by the external environment, helping us to inform the debate on matters of major public policy importance. In particular, we plan to deepen our understanding of the evolving payments landscape, utilising our research capabilities to contribute to debates on central bank digital currencies such as the Digital Euro, as well as the future of privately-issued money. A key focus will remain on the ongoing fragmentation of the multilateral rules-based order and threats posed by tariffs, as well as the macroeconomics of growing defence spending in Europe. We will continue to focus on the European system of financial intermediation of savings to investments, understanding cross-border capital flows, the role of non-bank intermediaries, and the scope for productive savings to be deployed more productively within the European economy. Conclusion In closing, I want to extend my thanks to everyone who has contributed to organising this event, as well as to all of you for attending, particularly our speakers. This workshop is an invaluable opportunity to connect economists and policymakers from diverse backgrounds, fostering both enduring friendships and new, fruitful, collaborations that sustain the value of shared inquiry and the flourishing of fact-based research and analysis. I wish you a productive and enjoyable conference and, for those visiting from abroad, a memorable stay in Dublin.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Money is at the heart of what central banks do. Ever since central banks have existed, their core role has been to issue money and protect its value. That mandate will not change – but the technological environment in which we deliver it is changing, and it is changing radically. Digital payments are now the norm, and new technologies are disrupting financial services. Financial institutions have become technological entities, and tech firms have entered the spheres of payments and finance. Central banks are no exception. If they want money to remain stable, trusted and usable in a digital world, they must help shape that world and modernise central bank money. If they fail to do so, central banks may no longer be able to provide an anchor of stability to the financial system. In the euro area context, there are good reasons for the central bank to not just follow but take the lead in the transformation of money. As a monetary union, we share a single currency and a single monetary policy. For that to work, we must ensure the singleness of money across the euro area: one euro must always be worth one euro, no matter its form and no matter where in the euro area. The Eurosystem – that is, the ECB and the national central banks of euro area countries – has played a key role in this respect. In just 25 years the euro has become the currency of 20 countries (soon to be 21) and the world's second most important currency. The Eurosystem issues euro banknotes, which have become the tangible symbol of Europe's economic unity. And we have built robust infrastructures – T2 for large-value payments, T2S for securities, TIPS for instant payments and ECMS for collateral – which allow money and assets to move safely and efficiently across the euro area.

Honourable Minister of Finance, Senior Government officials, CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Members of the Eswatini FinTech Working Group, Industry leaders and financial sector partners, Development partners, Members of the media, Ladies and gentlemen, Good Morning! Introduction It is a pleasure to join you today for this important moment in our country's journey towards innovation and digital transformation in financial services. We are gathered here to witness the launch of the National FinTech Strategy of the Kingdom of Eswatini, a roadmap that speaks not only to where we are, but to where we want to go as a nation. It is not long ago when we gathered in this very same hotel to kick-off the development of the strategy. The speed of the review and renewed strategy is statement of the consistent changes in this space. This Strategy is a shared commitment to build a digital financial ecosystem that serves all Emaswati. Whether it is the farmer in Siphofaneni, the young entrepreneur in Mbabane, or the small trader in Siteki, this strategy aims to make financial services more accessible, more affordable, and more relevant to their needs. Today marks the start of a new phase for Eswatini, one that looks to innovation as a driver of growth, resilience, and inclusion. It is also a phase that recognises FinTech as an ecosystem, built through shared effort, clear roles, and active participation from everyone involved. A collaborative achievement Honourable Minister, a strategy of this scale does not come together by chance. It is the result of extensive collaboration across government, regulators, industry, academia, and our development partners. Distinguished guests, allow me to acknowledge the Ministry of Finance for its leadership, the Ministry of ICT, the FSRA, ESCCOM, RSTP, ERS, UNESWA, CBE and the industry leaders for bringing technical expertise and practical insight into the process. We are also grateful to the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, UNDP and Olayinka David-West Consulting for the support they provided in the drafting of this Strategy, keeping us anchored in international best practice while remaining focused on our local realities. Every organization and individual involved in this strategy should see themselves represented within it. This document embodies our shared vision, and the strength of our collective spirit inspires confidence in our drive toward success. Why FinTech matters? Globally, technology is reshaping how people pay, save, borrow, and invest. Eswatini has made progress. Our financial inclusion rate stands at 87%, driven by mobile money. Yet, cash still dominates transactions, infrastructure gaps persist, and many lack access to the full range of financial products. These challenges are opportunities. FinTech can help us reduce reliance on cash, expand credit for MSMEs, bring savings and insurance closer to underserved communities, and create new jobs for our youth. Most importantly, it allows us to leapfrog, adopting digital solutions without being constrained by legacy systems. The Central Bank's commitment Ladies and gentlemen, the Central Bank is proud to have been part of this work. Since establishing our FinTech Unit in 2018, we have prioritised responsible innovation. The regulatory sandbox; our role in the FinTech Working Group; and our efforts to modernise payment systems, all reflect our commitment to shaping a future-ready financial sector. As we move into implementation, we will continue balancing innovation with our mandate of financial stability, consumer protection, and market integrity. Our role is not to slow innovation, but to ensure it develops in a safe, secure, and sustainable way. We are ready to build the supervisory tools, the institutional capacity, and the partnerships needed to support this next phase. A call to collective action Distinguished guests, launching the Strategy is only the beginning. What matters now is execution. This will require leadership, intentionality, resources, and close coordination across public and private sectors. Government will be in the forefront in steering implementation. Regulators must remain agile. Financial institutions should embrace innovation. Entrepreneurs must build solutions that respond to real needs. Academia must cultivate the skills for a digital economy. Development partners must continue supporting our journey. Together, we can turn this vision into reality. The best of good times lies ahead. I thank you ALL! Related information More speeches from ""The Central Bank of Eswatini"" Country page: Eswatini",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Ladies and Gentlemen, The worsening of the geopolitical landscape, the acceleration of payment digitalisation, and the emergence of a new tokenised financial ecosystem have, in recent years, shed fresh light on the important role played in Europe by non-European players and technologies in our payment systems. These transformations and this role are increasing the risk of a loss of stability and strategic autonomy. For the Banque de France, in charge of maintaining financial and monetary stability within the Eurosystem, this growing risk justifies mobilising its resources to support the transformations underway while ensuring that stability and autonomy are preserved. We are now fully committed to this endeavour, and I would like to briefly outline its priorities and main aspects, after sharing a few observations and thoughts on the opportunities for transforming our euro payment systems and the resulting consequences. 1. Opportunities for transforming our payment systems Among the ongoing transformations in the payments landscape, I would highlight three that are of particular interest to the Banque de France, in respect of its mandate to maintain monetary and financial stability: 1. The gradual decline in the use of cash for transaction purposes to the benefit of digital payment solutions, which are currently dominated by cards in France and underpinned by the growth of e-commerce. This growing use of electronic payment solutions has contributed to simpler, faster, more practical and more secure payments, but it has two consequences that are likely to have a negative impact on the efficiency and security of our payment system: a. It increases our dependence on non-European players (particularly American ones) who already benefit from significant network effects and hold certain widely used proprietary standards (Visa, Mastercard). This dependence raises concerns regarding competition, strategic autonomy and data protection. Contrasting with these international players, European payment solutions appear highly fragmented and their market share has been gradually eroding. 1 b. It increases exposure to cyber risk , thereby creating challenges amplified by the wider use of AI, in terms of maintaining a high level of payment security, especially given the growing complexity of fraud schemes, which in particular involve manipulating payers and circumventing the strong authentication mechanisms put in place to ensure the security of digital payments in Europe. 2. The extension of digitalisation to financial assets, as part of a phenomenon known as ""tokenisation"". Tokenisation helps to improve the functioning of our monetary and financial system in terms of transparency and efficiency in the execution of transactions, as well as reducing transaction costs and times. Nevertheless, it does pose challenges, particularly in terms of settlement assets that can be used in this new tokenised financial ecosystem. The only settlement assets currently available are stablecoins. However, they are almost exclusively dollar-backed and are mainly issued by non-bank, lightly regulated non-European players, as is the case with the largest of them, Tether. This situation therefore poses a significant challenge in terms of monetary sovereignty, as the growing use of such assets in the euro area carries the risk of a form of ""digital dollarisation"". 3. An increase in competition, due to the development of tokenisation, in the area of infrastructures and related technologies. There has been a proliferation of initiatives from non-European players, with Google, 2 for example, entering the payments market. By increasing the number of competing infrastructures, these developments are contributing to the fragmentation of the post-trade landscape and are therefore a potential source of inefficiency. These transformations therefore harbour progress but also carry risks for the stability and strategic autonomy of our euro payment system. Indeed, these risks warrant particular attention as they have recently increased due to the active role played by the new US administration in promoting companies, technologies and stablecoins in order to maintain and strengthen the international role of the dollar. 2. The actions of Banque de France to help preserve the stability and strategic autonomy of the euro payment system. To reduce these risks, strong and concerted action between European public and private players is needed. The Banque de France is contributing to this by developing its actions to strengthen three important lines of defence, namely the regulatory framework, central bank money payment services, and the supply of public and private settlement assets in euro. 1. As regards the regulatory framework, the Banque de France strongly advocated the adoption of regulations that ensure effective consumer protection and the development of cryptoassets within a framework of trust. With PSD2 now in place and PSD3, soon to follow, we now have an advanced regulatory framework to reduce risks and protect users. Nevertheless, as regards crypto-assets, MiCA only partially addresses the risks posed by changes in the sector, particularly in the event of widespread adoption of stablecoins issued by non-European players. Against this backdrop, we are pressing for a strengthening of MiCA , particularly to restrict the use of stablecoins for everyday payments and to address the risks arising from multi-issuer models. 2. As regards central bank money payment services , for several years now the Banque de France has been working actively to adapt the services offered by the Eurosystem in central bank money to developments in the digitalisation of payments and tokenised finance. This adaptation is essential to maintain the anchor role played by central bank money in ensuring the stability of our payment system. It aims not only to change the form in which central bank money is made available for everyday payments (known as ""retail"" payments) and payments between intermediaries in the financial system (known as ""wholesale"" payments), but also to use new infrastructures to make it available , which are adapted to the development of the tokenised circulation of financial assets that are issued, transferred and stored using decentralised infrastructures such as blockchains. To this end, the Eurosystem has launched three strategic and complementary projects: The digital euro. Its aim is to ensure that a means of payment in central bank money in the form of a ""digital banknote"" with the main attributes of a ""paper"" banknote remains available in the range of pan-European payments for digitalised transactions. It should thus facilitate the development of the digitalisation of payments in Europe, by preserving the freedom of choice we enjoy between public and private monies for our everyday payments and by promoting synergies with private European payment solutions, with a shared aim of strengthening our strategic autonomy. This project is progressing at a sustained pace and has just entered a new phase to prepare technically for the possible issuance of the digital euro, once a regulation has set out the conditions under which it can be used. The ECB will only be able to take a decision on issuing the digital euro once this regulation has been approved by the Council and the European Parliament, which is expected in the middle of next year. The Pontes project. This project aims to provide participants in the tokenised financial asset ecosystem, particularly intermediaries, with a suitable central bank currency that is also tokenised and available on a blockchain. The objective is to ensure that central bank money, which is the safest settlement asset, remains the preferred settlement asset for financial asset transactions, which present the most sensitive systemic stakes. An initial version of this ""wholesale"" central bank digital currency will be available to banking institutions by the end of 2026. The Appia project. The aim of this project is to explore the potential of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) with a view to designing, in the medium term, a new generation of critical infrastructure for the European post-trade market, dedicated and adapted to the development of tokenised finance. It is currently very hard to predict how widespread tokenised finance will become compared to traditional dematerialised finance, which currently dominates our financial system. Market needs and forces will determine their respective shares in the medium term and long-term, but it is very important that Europe prepares itself today to establish a benchmark post-market infrastructure adapted to tokenised finance, which is efficient and therefore well integrated, and under European governance . This infrastructure could be based on a European Shared Ledger, enabling the exchange of tokenised assets and payments in CBDC and private bank money that is also tokenised. 3. Lastly, with regard to the supply of public and private settlement assets in euro , we at the Banque de France consider that, while the provision of an appropriate CBDC is essential, central bank money is not intended to meet all the settlement asset needs of the European real and digital economies. Alongside this, it is necessary to have a significant and effective supply of private money, particularly for everyday payments, which can be exchanged reliably at par with central bank money, provided by regulated players, foremost among which are naturally the major players in the provision of payment services, namely banks. The challenge today is therefore to consolidate and extend the benefits of the sound, stable and flexible monetary system we have for the euro, in order to ensure, with the necessary strategic autonomy, the settlement of trade within our economy and thus support its development. In this respect, the discussions and initiatives currently being developed by European financial intermediaries, such as those conducted by the European Payments Initiative (EPI) consortium, or those aimed at developing a range of tokenised deposits and stablecoins in euro, particularly to meet the cross-border transaction and cash management needs of international companies, are very important and welcome , and we are ready to play a facilitating role in the development of these products wherever necessary. Conclusion It will be clear from my remarks that at the Banque de France, we are fully committed to monitoring, understanding and supporting the major transformations underway in the payments landscape. This commitment leads me to conclude with an observation and a conviction: The observation is that the ongoing transformations in the payments landscape are bringing progress, but they also carry the risk of a loss of stability and strategic autonomy for our euro payment system. The conviction is that in order to respond to this risk in an appropriate and adequate manner we need to mobilise all the relevant European players. This involves, in particular, developing secure, efficient, pan-European public and private payment solutions based, for settlement assets, on the coexistence, complementarity and substitutability at par between public money issued by the central bank and private money issued by European financial intermediaries regulated to that effect.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Presentation accompanying the speech Chart 1: Policy rate kept unchanged at 4 percent The Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 4 percent. If the economy evolves broadly as currently envisaged, the policy rate will be reduced further in the course of the coming year. Norges Bank is tasked with keeping inflation low and stable. The operational target is inflation of close to 2 percent over time. We are also mandated to help keep employment as high as possible and to promote economic stability. In response to the inflation surge in 2022, we raised the policy rate sharply and rapidly, and the tightening of monetary policy has contributed to cooling down the Norwegian economy and to dampening inflation in recent years. In June, we began a cautious normalisation of monetary policy, and the policy rate has been reduced from 4.5 percent to 4 percent. The job of tackling high inflation has been fully completed, and we judge that restrictive monetary policy is still needed. If the policy rate is lowered too quickly, inflation could remain above target for too long. On the other hand, we do not want to restrain the economy more than needed. Chart 2: We do not expect a large decrease in the policy rate We are not in a hurry to reduce the policy rate. The forecast we are presenting today is consistent with 1-2 rate cuts next year and a further reduction to somewhat above 3 percent towards the end of 2028. As such, we do not envisage a large reduction in the policy rate ahead. The average residential mortgage rate is expected to decline to just above 4.5 percent in 2028. The interest rate outlook is little changed since September, when we last presented forecasts. Let me say a few more words about the background for the decision and the Committee's assessments. Chart 3: Inflation has not declined further over the past year Inflation is still too high. After falling markedly in 2023 and 2024, inflation has changed little over the past year. Figures published last week showed that inflation was 3 percent in November. The post-pandemic surge in inflation was triggered by an import price shock. While imported inflation is now low, the rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services remains high. The rapid growth in wages in recent years has raised firms' costs, which will likely restrain disinflation ahead. Wage growth will probably be high this year too, but lower than last year. We expect a continued moderation in wage growth in the next years. The krone has depreciated and is weaker than assumed in the previous Report. A weaker krone means higher imported goods inflation, which contributes to raising inflation prospects somewhat going forward. Chart 4: Growth in the Norwegian economy has picked up this year Growth in the Norwegian economy was low through 2023 and 2024. Developments have been especially weak in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the Norwegian economy. Unemployment has increased, and registered unemployment is now at about the same level as before the pandemic. Growth in the mainland economy has picked up this year, but several indicators point to slightly weaker developments in the economy since the previous Report. Employment growth has been a little lower and registered unemployment a little higher than expected. At the same time, Norges Bank's Regional Network contacts report that it has become slightly easier to recruit labour. Our assessment is that there is now slightly more spare capacity in the Norwegian economy than we assumed in September. Chart 5: Inflation down to target without a marked increase in unemployment With the current policy rate path, the number of unemployed is expected to increase a little over the next couple of years. A gradual decline in wage growth ahead will contribute to pushing down inflation to close to 2 percent in 2028. The moderate upturn in economic activity is projected to continue ahead, but growth will probably be somewhat lower than this year. Wages are expected to rise faster than prices, and combined with somewhat lower interest rates, this means that most people will likely see an improvement in their purchasing power and consumption will continue to grow. Housing construction is expected to pick up over the next years, but the level of housing investment will likely be markedly lower in 2028 than before it started to fall in 2022. If the economy takes a different path than currently envisaged, the policy rate path may also differ from that implied by the forecast. Unpredictable conditions for international cooperation and trade are creating uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and growth both internationally and in Norway. If labour market conditions weaken more than expected or the outlook indicates that inflation will return to target faster, the policy rate may be lowered faster. On the other hand, if growth in business costs remains elevated for longer, or the krone proves weaker than projected, inflation could remain elevated for longer than currently projected. A higher policy rate than currently envisaged may then be required. But our objectives stand firm. We will finish the job and ensure that inflation is brought all the way back to 2 percent.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear Rector Hoxha, Dear Professors, Students, and Participants, It is a special pleasure to be with you today at this remarkable international conference-a gathering that bridges academic research and economic practice. It focuses on one of the greatest challenges of our time: how to build intelligent and resilient economies that are guided by the principles of smart specialization. Today, as technological transformation advances at an unprecedented pace, countries face an urgent need for new development strategies-strategies that weave together knowledge, innovation, and technology with forward-looking public policies and the cultivation of human capital. Digital transformation is no longer an option-it is the very foundation on which the economies of the future will be built. Artificial intelligence and automation are opening new doors for growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. For developing countries like Albania, technology provides the potential to overcome structural barriers, reduce transaction costs, enhance transparency, and reach new markets faster than ever before. This transformation requires more than investments in digital infrastructure. It demands strong commitments to education, research, and innovation-so that technology becomes not just a tool, but a driver of economic transformation. At the Bank of Albania, digital transformation has become a strategic objective, directly affecting the way the financial system operates in Albania. One of the most important milestones achieved recently is Albania's integration into SEPA, which came into effect on 7 October 2025. As we have emphasised before, for citizens and businesses, it means faster payments across Europe, lower costs, higher security standards and greater opportunities for trade, investments, and digital services. In parallel, we are working with our international partners to modernise the national payment systems enabling instant and secure payments 24/7, expanding the use of electronic payments, reducing reliance on cash, and strengthening both competition and innovation in the financial market. But innovation goes far beyond the digitalisation of payments or new financial products; it affects the way monetary policy is designed and implemented and how financial stability is monitored. At the Bank of Albania, we are applying advanced models to forecast inflation, employing data analytics to assess risks in the financial system, digitalising the way of gathering statistics and collecting data, and strengthening transparency through new tools of public communication. Bank of Albania supports the idea that innovation and investment in knowledge may build an economy that is both more competitive and more resilient. The academic community has an irreplaceable role to play in this process. The University of Tirana - and particularly the Faculty of Economy- stands as one of the most important centres of economic though and expertise in Albania. Scientific research, international partnerships, and the promotion of start-ups and innovation labs are bridges that connect theory with practice and academia with market. Preparing new generations who understand the digital economy, modern finances, the role of data and the challenge of green transition is a multi-dimensional investment for the society. Dear guests and participants, Public institutions-such as the Bank of Albania- and universities share a vast space of collaboration: from exchanging data and engaging students and researchers in real research projects, to developing new analytical models, professional programmes practical training, and capacity-building in areas such as financial stability, monetary policy, payment systems and financial education. In an economy that aspires to be smart and integrated, these partnerships are not a luxury- they are an absolute necessary. Our shared challenge is to make sure these partnerships translate into sustainable growth, higher productivity, greater opportunities for young people and an economy that is more open, more resilient, and more inclusive. Conferences like this one are the ideal spaces where innovative ideas take shape, where challenges are discussed openly and where meaningful partnerships are built. I am confident that your discussions will contribute not only to academic though, but also to the development of polices and best practices for small economies. I wish you success in the proceedings of the conference, and I thank you for the invitation and the opportunity to share our vision with you today. Thank You!

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Introduction Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be back home in Montréal, especially at this time of year. And it is wonderful to see so many of you again. My final speech of the year is always an opportunity to reflect on the year that was and to look ahead to the year to come. This year, 2025, was marked by the US swerve to protectionism and the resulting upheaval in global trade. It's a story about uncertainty, and about the loss of trust in our trade relationship with our biggest and best partner. As I look to the year ahead, trust and stability will be critical themes. At its core, the role of the Bank of Canda is to maintain trust in our monetary system. Trust that the bank notes we issue are secure. Trust that our financial system is stable and efficient, so you can be confident that your money is safely stored and easy to use. And trust that the purchasing power of your money will be stable. The other theme for the year ahead is innovation. Stability does not mean standing still. We want to support innovations in money and payments that serve Canadians. That's why, starting this year, we are overseeing retail payments. And next year, the Bank will add two more responsibilities: regulating stablecoins and implementing consumer-driven banking. With our role as the provider of cash and the supervisor of payments systems, and our mandate to control inflation, these new responsibilities make the Bank a one-stop shop for money you can trust. That's what I will talk about today-money. Good money. Money that is safe, money that trades at par in all its forms, and money that has stable purchasing power. The Bank must ensure trust and stability of money in all its forms-now, and in the future. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's get going. The essence of money So, what is money? Economists typically define money by its functions: a unit of account, a store of value, and a way to trade and transact with trust. 1 Simply put, money is what money does. That's why I think of money as both the medium-physical bank notes or digital money-and the infrastructure it travels on. Money isn't much good if you can't move it around. But when it moves safely and efficiently on trusted infrastructure, money provides vital services to us all. There are two kinds of money: central bank money and private sector money. Central bank money includes bank notes-the cash in your wallet-and settlement balances, which are deposits at the Bank of Canada by members of the payments system. Central bank money is the foundation of the financial system because the central bank stands behind it. Think of a $50 bill. On its own, it's just a piece of red polymer with an image of an icebreaker in the Arctic. It's worth $50 only because everyone agrees it's worth the amount written on it-now and in the future-and everyone trusts that the central bank will back it. Maybe this seems a bit archaic, but my signature is on the money to certify we stand behind every note. Then there's private sector money. Part of that is banking: the digital money that includes deposits at financial institutions. And part of it is payments: the infrastructure that moves money easily and safely. Private sector money also includes innovations in money, like stablecoins, which I'll get to in a minute. Central banks play a role in private sector money, too: together with bank regulators and deposit insurance providers, we're the stewards for the infrastructure that allows money to be stored and moved securely and efficiently. It's critically important to the Bank that Canadian money is good money. That it's trustworthy and secure. That it can be converted to cash, dollar for dollar, no matter its form. That it trades hands with minimum transaction fees and holds its value with low inflation. Good money ensures an efficient and inclusive financial system. It's what economists call a ""public good""-something everybody can use and benefit from. Without confidence in money, it's hard to be confident about our economic system. The future of bank notes Now let's get more concrete, starting with the simplest form of money-cash. Cash has undeniable benefits. It's simple, widely accepted, inexpensive to use and reliable. It works during power failures and internet outages and is not vulnerable to cyber attack. About 80% of Canadians-perhaps surprisingly, both old and young-and 96% of small- and medium-sized businesses use cash. While the use of cash for daily transactions has declined, cash remains important to many Canadians. It accounts for one in five transactions at the point of sale, and the demand for cash continues to grow with the economy. To be good money, the bank notes we issue have to be easy to authenticate and hard to counterfeit. We issued our first series of notes in 1935, shortly after the Bank was founded. That first series of notes had raised ink and small green dots scattered in the paper, which made the notes hard to counterfeit at the time. But threats have evolved. Our newest bank note will be issued in early 2027. The new vertical $20 will showcase an innovation in anti-counterfeiting security. We've used 3-D features before, and we've used features that shift when the note is moved. Our $20 note will combine these two technologies for the first time. I wish I could tell you more, but you'll have to wait for the unveiling next year. What I can tell you is that the new $20 note will feature King Charles III on the front and the Canadian National Vimy Memorial on the back. A new $5 note will follow soon after, picturing Terry Fox. And work has begun to develop larger denominations-the $50 and the $100-to build on the security features of this new series of notes. To be good money, cash also needs to be accessible. And I want to assure you that even as other forms of payment are growing faster than cash, we are committed to ensuring Canadians continue to have access to cash. Developments in digital money Digital money is less tangible than a $50 bill, but it's everywhere-sitting in bank accounts or moving through payment and settlement systems, across international borders and between your phone and e-commerce websites. There are about three billion Canadian bank notes in circulation, representing about $120 billion in value. By comparison, the money in Canadian chequing accounts is about $1.6 trillion. That digital money has to be good money too-just as secure as bank notes. There are two fronts to protect: banking and payments. On the banking front, Canada has strong regulators-the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and its provincial counterparts-that monitor banks and credit unions to ensure their operations are sound. And money in Canadian bank accounts is insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or its provincial counterparts. The second front is payments-money in motion. Advancements in technology mean Canadians are using digital payments more often. Ideally, you don't think much about the plumbing of Canada's payment systems. You tap, and you trust that your money will get from one place to another. The Bank supervises the infrastructure that moves these digital payments. For some 30 years, we've overseen Canada's large-value payments system as well as the clearing and settlement systems critically important to the financial system. About 10 years ago, our oversight was expanded to include other prominent payment systems, including Interac e-Transfer® and the largest credit card networks. This year, the Bank began overseeing retail payments. Since this is a new function, let me explain how it works. When money is moving, it's facilitated by payment service providers (PSPs). In Canada, there are all kinds of PSPs that help people store or move their money electronically: they offer digital wallets, provide point-of-sale terminals or facilitate cross-border money transfers. The Bank now supervises PSPs to ensure they manage operational risks and safeguard funds held on behalf of Canadian households and businesses, with close to 1,600 PSPs either already registered with the Bank or in the pipeline. This brings PSPs into the regulatory sphere so that Canadians can safely access cheaper payment options and a broader array of services. Now let's look to the future of digital money and our new responsibilities. Real-Time Rail will speed up payments First, the Bank is working with Payments Canada to modernize Canada's national payments infrastructure through a project called Real-Time Rail. This will allow payments to clear and settle instantly, 24-7, 365 days a year-making payments here much more efficient. In time it will also allow Canada to link our system to those in other countries so that money can move across borders more quickly. Real-Time Rail will also give PSPs direct access to the payments system, increasing competition and adding efficiency. Stablecoins may bring payment innovation Next is the frontier of digital money: stablecoins-a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to be money. The biggest cryptocurrency by value is Bitcoin. Bitcoin has some features of money-it did create a new unit of account-but it's not really money. Its price is very volatile, making it a lousy store of value, and it's difficult to use in everyday transactions. It's more of an investment, albeit a speculative one. Stablecoins are different. They're designed with the intention to always be convertible to a currency at par. So they overcome the price volatility of other cryptocurrencies while taking advantage of the same technology. The biggest stablecoins in circulation right now are Tether and Circle's USDC, both pegged to the US dollar. Other stablecoins have been issued in euros, and there are proposals for stablecoins pegged to the Canadian dollar. The stability of stablecoins means they hold more promise as a form of payment, although it's hard to know how much of a role they'll play in the future of money. The US GENIUS Act created a legislative framework for stablecoins and opened the door to their broader use in global payments. And the industry is keen to deliver. Other countries are also looking at how to bring the benefits of stablecoins to businesses and consumers while minimizing the risks of fraud or instability. It is important for Canada to have its own regulatory framework for stablecoins. In the federal budget last month, the government announced it will do just that, with the Bank of Canada as the regulator. The draft legislation lays out the core elements of the framework. The proposed Stablecoins Act will regulate stablecoin issuers, and the retail payments legislation will be amended so that it also applies to stablecoin payments. The goal is to ensure Canadians can leverage the innovation of stablecoins and do so safely. We want stablecoins to be good money, like bank notes or money on deposit at banks. That requires a few critical elements. A stablecoin must be pegged at a one-to-one ratio to a central bank currency and be backed by high-quality liquid assets so that it can always be converted to cash at par. The conditions for redeeming stablecoins must be fully disclosed, including the timing and any fees that need to be paid. Stablecoins made available for purchase by individuals and businesses in Canada should be assured of these protections. And issuers of stablecoins must have enough operational resilience to make stablecoins reliable. We will work closely with the Department of Finance Canada to support the drafting of regulations next year so Canadians can use stablecoins with confidence. Open banking gives Canadians more control The Bank's other new responsibility is part of the push for consumer-driven banking, also known as open banking. For money to work for Canadians, Canadians must be confident the banking system is working for them. Open banking will give you more control over your financial data, so you can do more with your money. It will make it easier to compare banks and switch providers or share data with third parties such as budgeting apps, investment tools or credit applications. It will make the system more efficient and more competitive, and it should drive innovation. As with Real-Time Rail and stablecoins, we need to ensure supervision of participants and high standards for technology in open banking to safeguard customer data and minimize the risk of fraud. Open banking is a bit different from our other responsibilities, but the overlap with the other parts of our supervisory mandate is clear: the Bank has experience keeping money and payments secure so you can use your money safely and easily. Open banking extends this to storing and moving financial information safely and easily. The regimes for stablecoins and open banking must be built thoughtfully. The technology is evolving rapidly, and the regulatory framework will need to evolve to keep pace with the changing landscape. It is important that Canadians can benefit from new technology and new services-safely and securely. Preserving the value of money That brings me to the final component of good money: it needs to hold its value. All the forms of money I've mentioned, from bank notes to stablecoins, must have stable purchasing power. In Canada, as in most other major countries, we have defined that as 2% inflation. When inflation is around 2%, the value of our money is relatively stable and the economy works well. We don't have to go back far in time to remember how painful it can be if we don't preserve the value of our money. Canada's economy overheated in 2022 when the post-pandemic surge in demand ran up against still-impaired supply chains. Combined with Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, this pushed inflation just above 8%. The cost of both goods and services rose too fast. The money people had was buying fewer goods and services. People felt ripped off. When inflation gets out of control, we lose price stability-and we risk losing trust. If elevated inflation persists, it becomes entrenched in people's expectations, making it more difficult to bring inflation back to target. That's why we responded forcefully, raising interest rates at a historically rapid pace. It worked. Longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, and we were able to restore 2% inflation without a recession. But high inflation has had a lasting impact. Inflation has been back around 2% for more than a year, but price levels are a lot higher than they were before the pandemic. That's why it's so important that inflation stay low and stable, so incomes can catch up. The pandemic experience reminds us that trust cannot be taken for granted-it has to be earned and maintained. In Canada, we review and renew our monetary policy framework with the federal government every five years. It's one way we preserve Canadians' trust. With the renewal coming up in 2026, we're taking a fresh look at whether our inflation-targeting framework is still fit for purpose. As we review, we recognize that structural shifts-the rise of artificial intelligence, climate change, trade disruptions and geopolitical instability-make global economies increasingly vulnerable to shocks and uncertainty. We want to be sure the way we use our flexible inflation-targeting framework gives us the best chance of keeping inflation low and stable in a more shock-prone world. We want to provide the best information to Canadians about how we're doing that. And we want to better understand the link between inflation and housing affordability. One thing we're not reviewing is whether 2% inflation is the best target. We're confident it is. Flexible inflation targeting has proven to be more successful and more durable than anything that came before. In the 25 years leading up to the pandemic, inflation in Canada averaged very close to the 2% target and was inside the 1% to 3% band about 80% of the time. And yes, the pandemic tested our framework like never before, but as difficult as that was, the framework guided our actions to restore low inflation. Faced with a more shock-prone world, the anchor provided by the 2% target looks more important than ever. But we need to look at how we conduct monetary policy to hit the 2% target. The economic landscape is shifting. Protectionist US trade policy and high tariffs are adding costs and creating economic volatility. More generally, ongoing structural changes are turning into headwinds that have the potential to disrupt supply and add inflationary pressures. The renewal of our monetary policy framework in 2026 is the opportunity to ensure we are ready for a more shock-prone world. Good money in all its forms is only as good as its purchasing power. Conclusion It's time for me to wrap up. This has been a pivotal year for the global economy. The reconfiguration of global trade and the restructuring of Canada's economy will likely continue to dominate the economic landscape in 2026. Last week, Governing Council maintained the Bank's policy interest rate at 2¼%. US tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and lumber have hit these sectors hard, and uncertainty is weighing on business investment. But so far, the economy is proving resilient overall. Inflationary pressures continue to be contained despite added costs related to the reconfiguration of trade. Total CPI inflation has been close to the 2% target for more than a year now, and we expect it to remain near the target. In the current situation, Governing Council sees the policy rate at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment. Uncertainty is of course still very high. If the outlook changes, we are prepared to respond. At the Bank of Canada, we are focused on managing the present and preparing for the future. We will support the economy through this period of transition while keeping inflation well controlled. And we will safeguard the essential features of good money-security, convertibility and price stability-while ensuring Canadians can benefit from innovations in money and financial services. We can and must be both a source of stability and an engine of progress. As money changes with innovation and our economy faces new challenges, the Bank of Canada will be there for Canadians. You can count on us to maintain the trust and stability of your money. Thank you. I would like to thank Melanie Achtemichuk, Theodoros Garanzotis, Oleksiy Kryvtsov, Francisco Rivadeneyra and Jing Yang for their help in preparing this speech. 1 Like so many before and after my time at university, I learned about the functions of money in my economics courses. When I was a graduate student at Western University, this took on more rigour in the study of what economists call the microfoundations of money-essentially modelling the services that money provides to people. With a model you can begin to assess the features of good money and the benefits to the economy. I was fortunate to learn about the microfoundations of money from Professor Peter Howitt, whose early academic work focused on modelling the transactions services of money. This year Peter Howitt shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work with Philippe Aghion on the microfoundations of innovation and the process of creative destruction. But Peter Howitt's early work on the microfoundations of money is also important, and it was my good luck to be in his graduate Monetary Economics class.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear vice president Iotova, Dear colleagues, Let me start with a sincere gratitude to the Association of Banks in Bulgaria and all colleagues from the banking sector for the good cooperation and the results achieved. The most important of these is Bulgaria's accession to the euro area, a historic act of significance that will become clearer and more tangible over time. Today is a good time to highlight the key role of the banking sector in achieving this strategic goal. The events of recent days put the topic of the euro area in a slightly different context. This context is expressed in the question: how effectively can our political system, riven by opposition and confrontation, capitalise on this historic success. Joining the euro area is a strategic asset with enormous potential to accelerate the modernisation of the economy, support investment and strengthen the country's resilience in the face of global risks and geopolitical uncertainty. To harness this potential, we need a predictable political environment and a disciplined economic and fiscal policy. Bulgaria's economy has shown resilient performance amid domestic political and social turbulences and external shocks that we are witnessing. Economic growth is above the EU average, while inflation – despite all the turmoil – is normalising and moving closer to levels in the euro area, an area of low and sustained inflation. Employment is close to its historical maximum. In such an environment, the banking sector remains stable, with strong liquidity, high capitalisation and sustained profitability. This is an important signal to both society and investors. We must remember, and I think we should emphasise repeatedly, that the good performance of the economy is largely due to Bulgarian businesses and the private sector adapting to a difficult environment and creating value despite the challenges . I have always seen the banking sector as a strong partner for the most active and productive part of the economy, a partner that not only provides financing but also supports growth through expertise, technological innovation and high quality management. The current results of the economy and the banking sector, despite the difficulties, are solid evidence of this interaction. The primary task at hand is to successfully complete the process of introducing the euro on 1 January. All the details in this process are important, although the heaviest part of the work has already been done. To ensure a seamless and frictionless transition, we need to maintain full mobilisation until the beginning of next year. Over the past few days we have seen a strong demand for the Bulgarian euro coins, a demand that far exceeded the pre-orders. In some places, especially in the post office system and in smaller towns, the feeling of 'not enough' was created, even though there was no real shortage. This episode shows that we need to maintain close coordination and be ready to react quickly. The principle we follow at the Bulgarian National Bank is that we bear full responsibility for everything relating to the changeover process, even when specific difficulties arise from counterparties whose actions we cannot directly influence. In a broader perspective and in the context of 2026, our key task will be to continue supporting economic activity while keeping our role as a source of stability and confidence. The year 2026 will be the first year in which Bulgaria will be fully and actively involved not only in the formation, but also in the implementation of the euro area monetary policy. The main responsibility in this process lies with the Bulgarian National Bank, but a key factor for success will be the continued close interaction between the central bank and commercial banks which play a crucial role in the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. Dear colleagues, Allow me to wrap up by extending my heartfelt thanks to you once again for the professionalism, partnership and efforts you have put in over the past year, and not only over the past year, and which have made it possible for the country to make one of its most important national priorities a reality. With these words, I congratulate you on Banker's Day and wish you good health and success, both personally and professionally.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear Pierre 1 , Ladies and gentlemen, Colleagues and friends, Thank you for the generous introduction, and thank you to the European Stability Mechanism for hosting this evening's event. It is a pleasure to join so many distinguished representatives of financial community. The ESM has become an essential pillar of the euro area's financial architecture-a demonstration of Europe's capacity to act with discipline, responsibility, and solidarity. As Jacques Delors once reminded us, ""Europe is a journey requiring both vision and persistence."" Tonight, Bulgaria stands at the threshold of an important step in that journey: joining the euro area. A Natural Completion of Bulgaria's European Path Bulgaria's readiness to adopt the euro is not the result of a single moment. It reflects more than two decades of consistent economic orientation and institutional alignment. Our currency board-anchored first to the Deutsche Mark and then to the euro-has provided the foundation of macroeconomic stability for over 25 years. The euro has long been our de facto monetary anchor, shaping expectations and encouraging discipline across households, firms, and the public sector. Since 2020, we have been part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, applying the same supervisory standards as euro-area banks. Under ERM II, our authorities have worked systematically to meet every legal, operational, and institutional requirement for the changeover. In this sense, euro adoption is not a new beginning. It is the formal completion of a trajectory that has defined Bulgaria's economic model for a generation. A Strong Anchor in an Uncertain World We meet at a time of elevated geopolitical tensions, tighter financial conditions, and accelerated structural change. In such circumstances, the value of a credible monetary anchor becomes even clearer. Euro-area membership brings Bulgaria three important advantages. First, it strengthens confidence. Participation in the Eurosystem's monetary policy framework offers predictability and reinforces trust among investors, banks, and households. Second, it deepens integration with European financial markets-improving financing conditions, reducing transaction costs, and supporting long-term investment. Third, it enhances resilience through access to the euro area's stability instruments-tools designed not only to manage crises but also to prevent them. These benefits support Bulgaria's convergence path and reinforce its capacity to navigate uncertainty. Public Confidence and Clear Communication We understand that citizens have concerns, particularly around prices. These concerns are not unique to Bulgaria-they accompany every changeover. But decades of experience across the euro area show that these effects are temporary and limited, especially when addressed through strong oversight, dual pricing, and transparent communication. Our message is simple: the institutional safeguards are strong, and they protect consumers. Institutional Readiness-Thorough and Complete The Bulgarian National Bank has prepared extensively for the changeover through a comprehensive set of decisions covering legislation, payment systems, cash operations, logistics, and IT security. Our banks are liquid, well-capitalised, and technically prepared for operations in euro from day one. These preparations reflect close cooperation with the ECB, the European Commission, national institutions, and the ESM. Political Continuity-A Nuanced but Real Consensus Euro adoption requires political responsibility and societal confidence, not only technical readiness. Bulgaria is currently experiencing political tensions and surges of public pressure. These dynamics are part of democratic life, and they have generated intense debate. But throughout these changes, the strategic direction toward the euro has been maintained. Support for euro adoption extends across the political spectrum and is reflected in a constitutional majority. This is not a consensus of unanimity; it is a consensus of continuity-anchored in the recognition that Bulgaria's long-term security and prosperity are strengthened through deeper European integration. This continuity gives credibility to the accession process. Looking Ahead-Europe's Stability Architecture and the Challenges Before Us As we look forward, we must recognise that Europe is operating at an inflection point. The global economy is becoming more fragmented; geopolitical tensions have become structural; Europe's competitive position is under pressure; and the green and digital transitions demand substantial and sustained investment. These developments will test our institutions and policy frameworks. They require Europe to reinforce its capacity to act, to strengthen its economic governance, and to safeguard the credibility of the frameworks that anchor stability-monetary, fiscal, and financial. It is in this context that Europe's strengthened stability architecture becomes especially important. The reform of the ESM Treaty-once fully in force-will allow the ESM to provide the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, reinforcing the credibility of the Banking Union and strengthening Europe's ability to respond to crises with confidence and coherence. For Bulgaria, joining the euro area at this moment means assuming a share of these responsibilities from the very beginning. As a member of the ECB's Governing Council, I will seek to contribute with independence and professionalism to the formulation of the single monetary policy-guided by the mandate of price stability and aware that the decisions we take in the coming years will shape Europe's resilience for decades to come. Bulgaria brings relevant experience: that of a small, open economy long accustomed to operating under strict monetary constraints, maintaining fiscal discipline, and adapting to external shocks. This experience will inform our contribution to the Eurosystem and support our collective effort to navigate an increasingly complex European and global landscape. Conclusion Allow me to conclude with the words of Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, one of the founding architects of the euro: ""The euro is a community of stability and trust."" For Bulgaria, joining this community marks the beginning of a more advanced stage of our European journey- one that strengthens our institutions, supports our citizens, and deepens our engagement with Europe's future. Behind every technical preparation lies a simple truth: the euro is about people- their savings, their security, and their opportunities. Thank you for your attention. I invite you to join me in a toast – to Bulgaria, to Europe, and to the euro-our shared foundation for stability and prosperity. 1 Pierre Gramegna, Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism Related information More speeches from ""Bulgarian National Bank"" Country page: Bulgaria",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

Our analysis covers 56 economies and 16 industries. We combine two elements. First, industries differ in how much they rely on cognitive and knowledge-based tasks, and so differ in their exposure to AI. Second, countries differ in their readiness to adopt new technology, based on their digital infrastructure, human capital, innovation capacity and regulatory frameworks. We measure industry exposure using data from the United States and country readiness using the International Monetary Fund's AI preparedness index. We then link these measures to the change in real value added in each country-industry pair between 2022 and 2023. Contribution Existing research focuses mainly on the United States and large advanced economies. Much less is known about how emerging market and developing economies stand to benefit from AI in the near term. Yet the structure of their economies differs, and many have weaker digital infrastructures. This raises the possibility that AI may widen global income gaps. Our paper provides one of the first global assessments of how sectoral exposure and country readiness interact to shape short-run growth. Findings We find that industries that rely more on knowledge and skilled labour gain the most from AI. Countries with stronger digital infrastructure, clearer regulatory frameworks and a more skilled workforce also see larger growth effects. Advanced economies tend to score higher on these dimensions, so they are likely to benefit more from generative AI in the short term. Many emerging market economies gain less, partly because their production structures are more concentrated in low-exposure sectors and partly because they are less prepared to adopt new technologies. These patterns hold even when we account for the use of robots. Overall, the spread of AI could widen global income gaps in the near future. Abstract This paper investigates whether the positive effects of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) on growth rate of value added differ across countries in the short run. Using an empirical strategy inspired by Rajan and Zingales (1998) and a dataset covering 56 economies and 16 industries, we find that the differential growth effects arise from variations in sectoral exposure to cognitive and knowledge-intensive activities, differences in production structures, and countries' AI preparedness. Our results suggest that, on average, gen AI is likely to benefit advanced economies more than emerging market economies, thereby widening global income disparities in the near term.

Standard macro-finance models suggest that yield curve factors should capture all bond and FX predictability, making other variables, such as inflation, irrelevant predictors. In other words, the information in these variables should already be ""spanned"" by the yield curve itself. However, we challenge this by showing that inflation acts as a common unspanned predictor of both bond and FX returns. We trace the origins of these findings to investors' incomplete information about the central bank's monetary policy rule. Contribution Our paper makes three key contributions. First, it generalises the yield spanning condition to non-linear models and exchange rates. Second, it provides novel empirical evidence that inflation is an unspanned predictor of both bond and FX returns, violating the spanning condition. Third, it provides a deep dive into the mechanism behind the result and presents a simple theoretical model to explain the observed deviations, emphasising the role of investors' incomplete understanding of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy rule. Findings We document that US inflation predicts both low bond returns and high dollar returns, even after accounting for the information embedded in yield curves. We attribute this finding to unexpected monetary policy tightening in response to high inflation, which leads to dollar appreciation and lower bond returns. We also identify that inflation predicts monetary policy shocks, expectational errors regarding long-term interest rates and revisions in perceived central bank policies. These findings suggest that investors struggle to fully grasp the Federal Reserve's reaction function, leading to predictable patterns in bond and FX markets. The proposed model illustrates how inflation can remain unspanned by yield curve factors, in line with the empirical facts. Abstract We generalize the yield spanning condition in the bond literature to non-linear models and to exchange rates. In standard macro-finance models, no variable should predict yield or exchange rate changes once standard yield curve factors are controlled for. We provide novel evidence that this spanning condition is violated, with inflation as a common unspanned predictor of both bond and exchange rate returns. Investors' incomplete information about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy rule emerges as the key driver of this result. We find high inflation to be followed by unexpected monetary policy tightening, which leads to dollar appreciation and low bond returns. We explain these findings by a simple model that departs from full information rational expectations.

Operating hour results have largely remained consistent year on year, but interest in 24/7 operations is noticeably increasing. The Asia-Pacific region is at the forefront of implementing interlinking arrangements. The adoption of ISO 20022 messaging standards and application programming interfaces (APIs) is progressing well.

A significant number of these jurisdictions are adopting a risk-based approach to prevent financial crime and are introducing digital identifiers for individuals and businesses. Introduction Enhancing cross-border payments critically depends on improvements in domestic payment infrastructures and harmonised legal and regulatory frameworks. This is because the first and last miles of a cross-border payment typically rely on domestic payment rails. Therefore, modernising domestic payment infrastructure is crucial for improving interoperability with other payment systems and across jurisdictions. These improvements are often part of a broader payment system strategy or financial sector reform. Improving payment infrastructures and the broader payment ecosystem requires significant time and effort. The Bank for International Settlements' Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), in cooperation with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), monitors progress on the G20 Roadmap priority themes for enhancing cross-border payments: (i) payment system interoperability and extension; (ii) data exchange and message standards; and (iii) legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks. The first monitoring survey among central banks was conducted in 2023, with results published in June 2024 ( here ). The CPMI and other international organisations are actively promoting the implementation of the guidance and recommendations that have emerged from the G20 cross-border payments programme over the past years. The second iteration of the CPMI-FSB monitoring survey in 2024 included questions about the status of and plans for implementing this work. This addition aimed at enhancing the data set while maintaining continuity in order to facilitate time series analysis where possible. This CPMI Brief presents the findings from the 2024 survey and compares them with the 2023 data. It is based on responses to the 2024 iteration from 68 central banks, 49 of which also participated in the 2023 survey. Read more .",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Presentation accompanying the speech Your Excellencies, Dear Friends, Hello and a very warm welcome to the Bank of Finland. This lunch seminar at the start of the holiday season is definitely one of the highlights of our calendar. I am delighted to see you here today, and I look forward to the lively discussion that is always an essential part of this gathering. Slide 2: Power politics is overshadowing the world economy Not long ago geopolitics was primarily the business of diplomats, international organisations and academia while for central bankers it remained background noise. That era has ended. Geopolitics now dominates every dimension of the economy and international cooperation. Both long-term megatrends and short-term twists and turns in world politics are currently reshaping growth prospects and inflation projections, monetary policy transmission and financial stability. I shall first discuss geopolitics and trade wars, and their ramifications on Europe and its economy. I will then turn to the outlook for the Finnish economy. While our recovery has been slower than expected, there are some promising developments as well. So, this time at least, I will resist the traditional Finnish saying that ""a pessimist is never disappointed"". The brutal realities of power politics are felt most painfully in Ukraine, though of course these realities have ramifications more broadly in Europe. The EU was caught off guard and was forced on to the defensive. Ukraine is fighting not only for its own freedom, but for the security of Europe and the future of liberal democracy and civil liberties. I trust Europe does not back away when faced with mounting pressure or immense challenges. We really have to get our act together. Together, we must stand with Ukraine until a just and lasting peace is achieved. Slide 3: Russian economy experiencing stagnation except for warrelated industries Russia's economy, while remaining sluggish, is still able to finance the Kremlin's war. The country's GDP growth has slowed to 1% this year due to worsening economic imbalances. Sanctions are limiting Russia's financing opportunities and technological possibilities. According to the recent forecast on the Russian economy by the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies, BOFIT, economic growth has been largely dependent on war-related industries. Sanctions have constrained Russia's access to critical goods and components for its military industry. Nevertheless, countries like China continue to export goods to Russia that have been sanctioned by Europe. However, here it pays to dig a little deeper. A recent research paper from BOFIT shows that China is now charging Russian customers more, sometimes much more, for the sanctioned goods. The median price increase between 2021 and 2024 for sanctioned goods bought by Russia is almost 90%. For many critical goods, such as ball bearings and piston engines, unit prices have more than doubled between 2021 and 2024. This is one way that sanctions are retarding Russia's capabilities, though not in the manner originally intended. Slide 4: Despite increased export barriers, China's goods exports have grown exceptionally well and boosted GDP growth China's exports have proven very resilient despite rising trade barriers. Even Russia has imposed restrictions on certain imports from China, such as cars. Yet China's exports continue to expand. So why is this? Producer prices have declined due to extensive capacity increases fuelled by subsidies, and the yuan has weakened, boosting competitiveness. As a result, net exports have supported growth at historically strong levels, with the current account surplus reaching almost USD 500 billion in January–September, more than any full-year surplus in China's history. It would be a considerable understatement to just call this a macroeconomic imbalance. Slide 5: European economy has demonstrated resilience despite higher US tariffs The current global situation creates a very challenging operating environment for both Europe and Finland. Against this global backdrop, the euro area economy has shown notable resilience. Growth has stayed positive and exceeded expectations this year, including in the third quarter. Rising real incomes, strong employment and increased defence spending have all provided support. In the ECB's September forecast, euro area growth was projected to be about 1% in both 2026 and 2027. Slide 6. Euro area inflation currently at around the ECB's 2% target The good news is that euro area inflation has this year stabilized at around the ECB's 2% target. At last month's meeting of the ECB Governing Council, we decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 2%. Our next rate decision will take place just before Christmas, on 18 December. When estimating the future path of GDP growth and inflation, there are now so many uncertainties and unknowns that it's a very tough task indeed. This can be summed up neatly with a phrase coined by our ski jumper legend and wordsmith Matti Nykänen: ""It's really sixty-fifty how it will turn out"". In other words, there are both downward and upward risks to growth and inflation, and the balance of these could go either way. Given this situation, it is reasonable for the Governing Council to wait for our comprehensive economic outlook in December. I should like to add here that in the current environment of uncertainty, it is essential that we do not lose sight of two things: firstly, the need for empirical evidence, taking a data dependent approach; and secondly, maintaining the commitment to our monetary policy strategy. If there are major deviations from our target over the medium term, then our strategy guides us to react – and the critical thing is to monitor if inflation expectations have stayed well anchored or not. In any case, we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, without committing to any interest rate path, thus maintaining full freedom of action in our decision-making. Under the current clouds of uncertainty, monetary policy-making is often as much art as it is science. Slide 7: AI boom is fuelling market valuations Beyond the confines of monetary policy, the ECB also supports stable and sustainable economic development in Europe. As First Vice-Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, I share the concerns about elevated stock market valuations driven by the AI boom in the United States. Alongside the IMF we have stated that the possible overheating of the stock market and its rapid correction could be a considerable risk. Market valuations now are quite high compared to the pace of growth in the real economy and corporate earnings. Slide 8: Capital buffers are critical for financial system resilience All investors should naturally be cautious, but in the mitigation of systemic risks, strong capital buffers are crucial. Stress tests confirm that European banks – not least Nordic banks – are resilient even in severe scenarios. Meanwhile, the EU's Savings and Investment Union initiative aims to mobilise Europe's substantial savings for productive investment and to diversify financing beyond the banking sector. Some diversification is already taking place – in the form of an expansion and diversification of the non-bank financial system. Regulators are now paying more attention to this non-bank spectrum than before. It includes investment and pension funds, insurance and finance companies, and companies specialising in securities trading. New players in the crypto markets also belong to this group. In Europe, the importance of non-bank entities in lending to businesses and households will continue to grow and it is indeed part and parcel of the Savings and Investment Union. At the same time, banks are increasingly providing financing to non-bank entities, which increases the financial markets' interconnectedness with the everyday regulated banking system. Slide 9: ECB preparing proposals to simplify regulation – High-Level Task Force on Simplification One of Mario Draghi's key recommendations for improving competitiveness relates to the simplification of regulation. In line with this, the ECB established earlier this year a High-Level Task Force on Simplification, in which I'm serving as a member. I am confident that our group's proposals will help simplify regulation where there is an undeniable need – how to simplify the overly burdensome regulatory load on banks, lighten reporting requirements and streamline banking supervision. At the same time, it is essential not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Banks' crisis and risk resilience must not be jeopardized. But no more on that now, as we have agreed to communicate only once the report is finalized, which is before Christmas anyway. Slide 10: IMF: The recovery of the Finnish economy has been slow but is expected to accelerate next year Turning now to Finland, recovery has lagged behind the euro area, slowed by weak employment and fiscal consolidation. However, recent data show signs of improvement, especially in industrial production. Many recent investments in Finland are linked either to critical technologies or infrastructure. A month ago, Nokia announced that NVIDIA will invest one billion dollars in Nokia to accelerate next generation AI innovation and to lead the transition from 5G to 6G. The number of new data centres and data centre investment projects in Finland has grown considerably, benefitting from relatively low energy prices – and with low emissions in the production of that energy. Finland has been building Arctic expertise for decades. This 'snow-how' is now coming to the forefront. The icebreaker deal between Finland, the US and Canada is estimated to be worth over 5 billion euros. Finland also possesses other critical expertise for Arctic regions: satellites, weather observation technology and energy technology, in addition to the 5G and 6G network expertise. A breath of fresh air – or appropriately slashy snow – was brought to Helsinki last week when the city hosted one of the world's largest growth company and technology events, Slush. Creativity, innovation and new business opportunities all wrapped up in one great event. Last month I invited members of the Finnish Startup Community to the Bank of Finland and we had a very useful and interesting discussion. Entrepreneurs and investors have reported that growth has accelerated and new startups are being founded, especially in the technology and software sectors. According to recent statistics, investments in Finnish growth companies have begun to rise again after the 2023 dip and are now close to the record level of 2022 (EUR 1.66 billion). Domestic venture capital investments are important not only in the early stages of companies but also later during scaling up and internationalisation. Slide 11: A parliamentary pact on fiscal rules was reached Finland's public finances have been under severe strain recently. This year the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 85%, and to over 90% by 2027. It is likely that Finland will end up in the EDP. Meanwhile it is encouraging that Parliament, following the Swedish model, has identified a common ambition to strengthen debt sustainability. This demonstrates that even in difficult circumstances, Finland can make responsible, forward-looking decisions together. Slide 12: Europe's triple test Going forward, Europe is facing major economic challenges – triple test . In a nutshell, strategic investment in defence, decarbonisation and dynamism can revitalise Europe's economic future. Russia's war in Ukraine and the US foreign policy shift have made it clear that Europe must take greater responsibility for its own defence. In the short term, the best way to strengthen European security is to support Ukraine. At the same time, national and common European projects must be launched to strengthen the EU's own common defence capability. The green transition is not a luxury – it is Europe's only viable energy strategy. Unlike the US, we lack (cheap) domestic fossil fuels. The path to energy security lies in renewables, clean tech and efficiency. We are reaching the inflection point in green transition. Decarbonisation is a chance for Europe to lead in clean tech and secure low-cost energy. It is not putting the brakes on growth: experience shows we can reduce emissions and grow at the same time. Developments over recent decades show that the green transition and GDP growth are not mutually exclusive goals. Long-term productivity gains are real: more efficient systems, new markets and stronger energy independence. For the EU, a net importer of fossil fuels, this is a win-win. It is a strategic imperative. Moreover, investment in common defence and in the green and digital transitions offers Europe a chance to revitalise productivity growth – but only if we do the right things. Unlike the US, Europe lacks deep capital markets and a unified innovation system. Defence spending won't drive growth unless it supports R&D and leverages private sector capacity. Europe is also underperforming as to channelling savings into investment. There are currently up to EUR 10 trillion in bank accounts, which represents a vast potential to be mobilised more productively for equity investment, offering higher return for European investors. The momentum for the Savings and Investment Union initiative is increasing and should now be accelerated by setting a clear, ambitious timeline for its completion, such as 1 January 2028. Above all, Europe must rediscover its traditional strength: talented people. We have top universities, skilled workers and a history of academic freedom. The US has relied heavily on imported talent. If that inflow is weakening, Europe must grasp this opportunity to lead again. But talent won't come here by accident. We need sound immigration policy, investment in education, and a culture that values research and risk-taking. Human capital is the foundation of long-term growth. Slide 13: Europe under pressure, Europe united In short: if Europe invests smartly in defence, decarbonisation and human capital, it can reignite its economic dynamism. Let me end with this: Europe's resilience comes not just from policies or institutions, but from how it works. The EU has always advanced by tackling real problems together, step by step. From coal and steel, to the single market, to the euro – and now to defence, the green transition and deeper capital markets – Europe has moved forward not through grand visions alone, but through concrete actions, steady commitment and shared solutions. That logic matters just as much today. When we strengthen Europe's common defence, push the green transition and invest in industrial competitiveness, we're not solving isolated issues. We are thus reinforcing the fabric of Europe itself. Before opening the floor for questions – I almost forgot one thing: Following the encouragement of friends and colleagues from various corners of Europe, and the support of the Finnish Government, I am standing as a candidate for Vice-President of the European Central Bank. Europe is, for me, a rational passion – a commitment shaped by experience and necessity. In an increasingly unpredictable world, small states have only one viable path: unity. The Union is our strategic shield and democratic anchor. By standing together, we protect our security, uphold our values, and secure a future welfare of our citizens. Thank you very much for your attention! I look forward to your questions and comments. Related information More speeches from ""Bank of Finland"" Country page: Finland",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

Between 2015 and 2021, house prices and household debt in China rose substantially. However, since 2021 the market has experienced a noticeable slowdown, raising concerns about the potential for a debt-deflation spiral akin to a boom-bust cycle. As the Chinese economy transitions towards a more consumption-driven growth model, the housing market plays a crucial role, given that property constitutes a substantial share of households' wealth. Despite the market's importance, the qualitative and quantitative effects of house prices on consumption in China remain underexplored. This paper fills this gap. We report estimates of the wealth effects of housing on consumption using household-level data. Contribution We leverage digital payment data to examine the relationship between housing wealth and consumption in China. Traditional consumption data often rely on surveys, which can lack timeliness and accuracy due to measurement errors. To address these limitations, we utilise one of the largest payment data sets – Alipay – to track household consumption expenditure. Specifically, we analyse monthly Alipay transaction data of Chinese households from January 2017 to April 2023. The data set includes information on users' geographical location, age and gender. We then integrate these data with survey information obtained via Alipay, which provides insights into home ownership and renting status. This combined data set allows us to comprehensively study housing wealth effects in China. Findings Our analysis reveals significant housing wealth effects: changes in house prices are positively associated with future changes in consumption in 33 Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Specifically, a 10% increase in house prices leads to a 1.6% increase in consumption in these cities. However, this relationship is not observed in smaller Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. Complementary regressions also show that housing wealth effects are more pronounced among older households and home owners, while renters exhibit no such effect. In contrast, in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities rising house prices appear to crowd out consumption for younger households.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Presentation accompanying the speech At its monetary policy assessment in September 2025, the Swiss National Bank decided to leave its policy rate at 0%. The SNB also indicated that it remains willing to be active in the foreign exchange market as necessary. The SNB makes monetary policy decisions, such as that taken in September, at its monetary policy assessments. These take place in March, June, September and December. Every decision is based on the SNB's mandate, which is to ensure price stability while taking due account of economic developments. The monetary policy strategy provides the framework for monetary policy decision-making. In it the SNB sets out its definition of price stability, namely an inflation rate of between 0% and 2%. The SNB seeks to keep inflation within the range consistent with price stability over the medium term. The monetary policy decision-making process is divided into two phases: the preparation phase and the monetary policy assessment phase. Shortly after the completion of a monetary policy assessment, the preparation phase for the next decision, during which economic developments are monitored and analysed, begins. Around the middle of the quarter, an interim assessment takes place. Economists from the Economic Affairs division report to the Governing Board on economic developments since the last monetary policy assessment and on whether the forecasts made at the last monetary policy assessment are still valid. The preparation for the monetary policy decision involves numerous staff members from across the SNB. The economists from the Economic Affairs division play a key role. They analyse data using statistical methods and develop forecasting models. In addition, each quarter, structured talks are held with around 250 Swiss companies whose economic situation is surveyed. Around two weeks before the monetary policy assessment the economists from the Economic Affairs division hold intensive discussions with the Chairman of the Governing Board and his deputies. Economic developments abroad and in Switzerland, as well as monetary indicators such as interest rates, exchange rates, monetary aggregates and loans, are also closely scrutinised. The economists then prepare the documentation for the monetary policy assessment. The Money Market and Foreign Exchange as well as the Financial Stability divisions also prepare assessments of the current environment for the Governing Board. This concludes the preparation phase. The monetary policy decision-making process is the same every quarter, irrespective of the prevailing economic environment. This structured and systematic approach facilitates the identification of changes as well as the need for monetary policy action. However, the process is by no means rigid or mechanical; rather, it allows the SNB to react flexibly to new developments. If the environment changes rapidly or unexpected developments occur, further analyses are carried out or scenarios simulated. The Governing Board can always decide to adjust monetary policy between quarterly monetary policy assessments. The second phase on the path to the monetary policy decision is the monetary policy assessment. The key question addressed is whether the current monetary policy stance is still appropriate to ensure price stability over the medium term. Are monetary conditions - a product of the level of interest rates and of the Swiss franc exchange rate - still suitable or should they be adjusted? When making its monetary policy decision the SNB sets the SNB policy rate. Changes to the policy rate affect the level of interest rates and the Swiss franc exchange rate. If necessary, the SNB can also use other measures, such as interventions in the foreign exchange market, to ensure price stability. On the first day of the monetary policy assessment, in addition to the Members and Alternate Members of the Governing Board, representatives from the divisions Economic Affairs, Money Market and Foreign Exchange, Financial Stability, International Monetary Cooperation and the Secretariat General, as well as from Communications, are present. If necessary, they answer specific questions from the Members and Alternate Members of the Governing Board. During the first day, the following topics are discussed: The Money Market and Foreign Exchange division starts by reporting on financial markets. These assessments may provide up-to-date information on monetary conditions and global risk sentiment, as well as on the implementation of monetary policy. Analyses of monetary conditions are carried out by the Economic Affairs division. The focus is on interest rate developments in Switzerland and the Swiss franc exchange rate. Growth in monetary aggregates and in loans is also carefully analysed. The Economic Affairs division then presents its analyses of global economic developments. These include economic activity abroad and forecasts for the global economy. Besides the growth outlook, further developments in inflation and in monetary policy abroad are also discussed. The baseline scenario for the global economy prepared by the Economic Affairs division is the basis for the forecasts for Switzerland. And finally, the Economic Affairs division explains the current economic situation in Switzerland as well as the latest growth and inflation forecasts. An important part of this is the approximately 250 talks that the SNB's delegates hold with Swiss companies every quarter. Topical issues from the Financial Stability division, such as developments on the real estate market and in lending, are also discussed. The presentations provide a comprehensive picture of the current environment. However, as some uncertainty always persists, it is essential to think in terms of scenarios. Prevailing risks are also analysed in detail. The second day of the monetary policy assessment is the day of the decision. In addition to the Members and Alternate Members of the Governing Board, the heads of the divisions Economic Affairs, Money Market and Foreign Exchange, Financial Stability, International Monetary Cooperation and the Secretariat General are present, as well as the heads of the Monetary Policy Analysis, Forecast and Analysis Switzerland, Regional Economic Relations, Forecast and Analysis International, Economic Data Science, and Communications units. First, the Economic Affairs division summarises the background situation for the monetary policy decision. The final discussion about the monetary policy decision can then begin. Here, the Governing Board consults on whether current monetary policy is appropriate, or whether it should be tightened or eased, to ensure price stability over the medium term. When making a monetary policy decision, the Governing Board takes a broad perspective. It considers the prevailing risks and performs a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis of various options. In doing so the SNB pursues a risk management approach, which allows for the fact that the decision is being taken under uncertainty about future developments. The aim of the risk management approach is to reach a monetary policy decision that is appropriate for a number of probable scenarios. Here, the Governing Board does not simply rely on forecasts for various scenarios, but it also uses its own judgement. Once it has made its decision, it signs off the communications material setting out and explaining the interest rate decision. A key element of the communications is the conditional inflation forecast. This shows how the SNB expects consumer prices to develop, assuming the given interest rate remains unchanged for the next three years. At 9.30 am on the Thursday at the end of the monetary policy assessment, a press release on the monetary policy decision, including a conditional inflation forecast, is published on the SNB website. From 10.00 am, a news conference takes place, which is broadcast live on the SNB website. At the news conference, the Governing Board first explains its decision in introductory remarks. Journalists then have the opportunity to ask the Governing Board questions. One week after the monetary policy assessment, the monetary policy report is published in the Quarterly Bulletin. Starting at the September 2025 assessment, a summary of the monetary policy assessment discussion is published four weeks after each monetary policy decision. This marks the end of the process and a new cycle begins. Related information More speeches from ""Swiss National Bank"" Country page: Switzerland",html,2026-01-07 09:40:09,,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today. When I offered my assessment of policy in my first speech as a Federal Reserve Governor in September, I assumed inflation for core goods and nonhousing core services would continue to run at current rates. While that was a useful working assumption at the time, today I will break down my inflation outlook in more detail. Specifically, I'll share my interpretation of inflation's components and how this influences my perception of progress toward our 2 percent target. Shelter Inflation Shelter costs are top of mind for households, and a large component of inflation indices. But calculating shelter inflation is far from simple. For instance, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index that the Fed targets includes housing costs for all households in the economy. That seems appropriate for capturing prices associated with all consumer spending but not ideal as a measure of current supply and demand pressures. Figure 1 makes that clear: As the economy emerged from the pandemic, demand for housing outstripped supply, and market rents for new tenants jumped. But the PCE shelter index for all households lagged, as rents only reset when people move or renew their leases. PCE will always lag market rents. As recently as last year, the PCE shelter index still had catching up to do, creating uncertainty as to how long measured shelter inflation would remain elevated. This is no longer the case. Indeed, a separate all-tenant rent index-drawn from the same microdata as PCE shelter-caught up to new-tenant rents, while PCE shelter has actually overshot new rents. Based on this catchup being complete, I expect a faster fall in PCE shelter inflation.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. I. Introduction Distinguished industry leaders, colleagues and guests. It is a privilege to be able to stand here and talk to such a learned gathering and I am thankful to Mint for inviting me. Money, as we know it, has been a central pillar of human society for centuries, enabling trade, facilitating economic activity, and underpinning the very notion of trust in social and financial interactions. Over time, the form of money has evolved with technology - from commodities to metal to paper to balances in deposit accounts to now, digital tokens. While the forms of money have evolved with technology, the fundamental character of money - what it represents, or what gives it credibility – has always been that it represents value that has users' trust. That value is either intrinsic (metal money) or derived from a promise to pay (paper money or deposit money) by a trusted person. Theoretically, money can be issued by any person as long as he has the trust of the users. The more stable forms of money in history have, however, always been issued by sovereigns, not by private issuers. Examples of private money (money issued by non-sovereigns) can be found in history but they have not been stable arrangements. In practice, therefore, money has credibility because its value is promised by the sovereign. This fundamental character of money is under challenge from cryptocurrencies. Not in terms of technology, as money in the form of digital tokens can exist without changing the nature of money itself. But the fundamental challenge of cryptocurrencies is that they claim to change the very nature of money – because cryptocurrencies do not represent value either in terms of intrinsic worth or in terms of promise to pay. In my talk today, I propose to explore what the nature of such challenge is, and what are the implications of cryptocurrencies for the financial system as we know it. To be able to understand the nature or character of money, we need to look a little deeper. II. Attributes of Money In a modern economy, there are two types of money viz., currency and bank deposits – currency (physical) is issued directly by the State (through its central bank) while deposits (digital) are issued under license by commercial banks. All money is issued either directly by the central bank or indirectly through banks authorised by it. Thus, all money in modern economies is effectively FIAT in nature. It is this fiat or sovereign aspect of modern money which creates 'trust' in money and provides it stability. A second defining feature of modern money is ""Singleness"", the property that different forms of money in an economy viz., cash, deposits, are denominated in a single unit and interchangeable at par. This 'Singleness' also arises from the fact that settlement of all transactions take place in central bank money. 'Singleness' of money ensures that trade and commerce are smooth without any concern for the value of different types of money. Ultimately, in modern economies, the fact that all ""money"" is fiat also ensures that money is SINGLE. Let us now sum up our understanding of what money has evolved into – that money represents VALUE trusted by users, that money is FIAT and, that money is SINGLE. Let us now see how a cryptocurrency measures up to these attributes of money. III. Attributes of Cryptocurrency The historical evolution of Cryptocurrency is the outcome of decades of search for a cyber solution for total anonymity of transactions outside of state control. The creation of Bitcoin in 2008 was the result of that search. Bitcoin, or rather, the Blockchain, the technology underpinning the Bitcoin, demonstrated that a digital token can be transferred between unknown counterparts without the need for an intermediary. The technology was revolutionary. But the Bitcoin itself was just a tool to demonstrate the technology, it had no value, either intrinsic or as a promise to pay. It was not money. The price of Bitcoin today does not represent value in the sense money has value. This value is purely speculative like the price of a tulip during the tulip mania of the seventeenth century. To summarise, cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. They are not backed by a promise to pay, that is, they have no issuer. Since they do not meet the basic attributes of money, they are not money. In fact, since they do not have any underlying cash flow, they are not financial assets as well, or, for that matter, any asset at all. How about Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies against which the ""issuer"" holds reserves to maintain a stable value. Since they are pegged to a fiat currency, they can perform the functions of a currency. Also, as they are backed by financial or other assets, they do represent value. Therefore, they have some of the basic attributes of a money. However, we need to keep in mind two factors. Is there a promise to pay? For stablecoins to be money the issuer needs to promise to pay par value to the holder. It is not clear whether Stablecoins are the liability of their issuers. It would appear that neither of the two major cryptocurrencies in use today make such unconditional promise. Is there a promise to pay? For stablecoins to be money the issuer needs to promise to pay par value to the holder. It is not clear whether Stablecoins are the liability of their issuers. It would appear that neither of the two major cryptocurrencies in use today make such unconditional promise. Assuming such a liability is legally established, the next point to keep in mind is that stablecoin is private money. Thus, stablecoins fail to satisfy the two defining features of modern money, viz., (i) money as fiat and (ii) singleness of money. It is possible that in a stablecoin system, there would be hundreds, or more, of currencies in an economy making any such system inherently unstable. Since we can reasonably establish that unbacked cryptocurrencies are not assets and merely speculative bets, akin to betting on a gambling event, we would focus, in the rest of this talk, on Stablecoins, which are close enough to money to pose a significant challenge to the financial system. First, let us look at the benefits of stablecoins that their proponents claim they have. IV. Benefits of Stablecoins Proponents of stablecoins present a range of claims, the more important of which are, improved cross-border payment efficiency, greater financial inclusion, and the ability to drive digital financial innovation. Efficient cross-border payments An oft cited benefit is that stablecoins can make payments, particularly cross-border payments faster, cheaper and more efficient. In the domestic space, real-time fast payment systems such as UPI already enable fast, low-cost, and reliable payments, and there is no reason to believe that stablecoins would be superior from the point of view of cost or speed or reliability. In the cross-border space, stablecoins can potentially enable faster and perhaps cheaper payments than what the current corresponding banking system provides, mainly because stablecoins do not face settlement risks. On the other hand, it is not certain that stablecoin issuers would have the same degree of acceptability as international banks that are closely regulated and backstopped by central banks. Also, the purported efficiency is doubtful when there are a large number of stablecoins in the ecosystem. Improve financial inclusion Another claim often made is that stablecoins enhance financial inclusion by providing access to digital money for those outside of traditional banking systems. Financial inclusion requires solutions that are accessible, affordable and safe. Many countries have made substantial progress in financial inclusion through digital public infrastructure and simplified account opening frameworks without the need to create parallel private forms of money. The inherent instability of stablecoins means they are clearly inferior alternative to fiat money as tools of financial inclusion. As stablecoins remain dependent on smartphones and digital wallets, internet connectivity and technical know-how, they may not be available to those segments of the population that are most in need of financial services. Bridge to the real economy Finally, supporters of stablecoins often argue that they can act as a bridge for the crypto ecosystem to the real economy. Yet the evidence today indicates that stablecoins remain primarily used as instruments to facilitate trading and leverage within the crypto market itself. Their role as meaningful transactional currency in everyday economic activity remains limited. To sum up, many of these benefits are neither unique to stablecoins nor have stablecoins yet established any of the benefits their proponents claim. By their very nature, they are in many ways inferior to available forms of money in achieving those benefits. On the other hand the risks they introduce to financial stability, and broader macro-financial stability are extremely serious. We will now take a closer look at these risks in detail before considering how India should approach stablecoins. V. Risks of Stablecoins Beyond the facilitation of illicit payments and circumvention of control measures, stablecoins raise significant concerns for monetary stability, fiscal policy, banking intermediation, and systemic resilience. Risk of Currency Substitution A core risk of stablecoins is currency substitution. Their design as currency-like instruments introduces the potential for currency substitution, particularly in emerging markets, where they could compete with domestic fiat money. Stablecoins, whether denominated in domestic currency or foreign currency, would reduce demand for the local currency and raise the risk of dollarisation. Risk to Monetary Policy Widespread adoption of stablecoins would undermine central banks' ability to control money supply and interest rates. ' If both an official currency and a crypto asset are used for pricing goods and services, domestic prices could become highly unstable due to the inherent volatility of the crypto asset. ' (IMF-FSB 2023). If residents increasingly hold or transact stablecoins, changes in domestic policy rates may have limited influence on economic decisions, weakening the effectiveness of monetary policy. Weakening Capital Account Management Stablecoins pose challenges for capital flow management (CFM) as domestic households diversify their balance sheets by including foreign-currency denominated stablecoins. This trend would make it difficult for authorities to implement capital controls, which are a critical instrument for financial stability in many emerging markets, including India. The pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions compounds these risks as it creates channels for unmonitored inflows and outflows, diluting the effectiveness of CFMs and complicating both macroeconomic management and external sector oversight. Bank and Credit Intermediation Banks are the primary entities that intermediate between savers and investors in an economy. This ability derives from banks' role in credit creation. To the extent stablecoins replace bank deposits, banks would lose their role in financial intermediation. This would result either in a rise in cost of credit as banks lose access to low-cost deposits, or banks having to depend on the central bank to provide the liquidity required to fund credit. A financial system that has to increasingly depend on central bank liquidity to fund commercial credit would not sustain. Systemic Risks The combination of weakened banks, reduced monetary policy effectiveness, and limited capital account management amplifies systemic vulnerabilities. Large-scale stablecoin adoption could expose domestic economies to external shocks and cross-border volatility, leaving traditional policy instruments less effective in managing financial stress. Loss of Seigniorage When a central bank issues currency, it receives equal value that is invested in assets like Government securities which are used to back the currency issued. These assets earn a return, which is significantly higher, than the cost of printing and issuing money. This difference – higher returns against lower cost of issue – is seigniorage income, which is transferred to the Government. Since currency issue is a social function, seigniorage income rightfully belongs to the Government, as the representative of the people. There is no case for seigniorage to accrue to private profit-making entities. Yet, this is exactly what Stablecoin issuers earn as income. Seigniorage, which is inherently a sovereign revenue arising from the issuance of fiat money by the central bank, is thus diverted to private operators, often located outside the home jurisdiction, if stablecoins are dominated in a foreign currency. It is likely that most countries will see a leakage of seigniorage income to private issuers of Dollar linked stablecoins. This loss of Government revenue does not receive the serious focus it deserves, not even from central bankers. Domestic-Currency Stablecoins Are Not Risk-Free Some argue that permitting domestic currency denominated stablecoins would not involve these risks. While such instruments may reduce risks to capital account concerns, the fundamental vulnerabilities such as currency substitution, bank disintermediation, reduced monetary-policy control, singleness and loss of seigniorage income remain. This is the reason why advanced economies are not immune to the risks posed by stablecoins. Stablecoins introduce real and severe risks ranging from monetary and fiscal disruption to banking disintermediation, to systemic instability. The risks are significantly higher for EMDEs, but they are also major risks for AEs. Understanding these vulnerabilities is critical before considering regulatory frameworks or policy adoption. It is not surprising then that global policy bodies and standard-setting organisations continue to highlight the risks of stablecoins. VI. Global Policy Responses Financial Stability Board (FSB) attempted to create a baseline for the regulation of global stablecoin arrangements through its High-level Recommendations 1 issued in 2023. But even these recommendations explicitly admit that they do not address virtually any of the major risks associated with Stablecoins – risks that particularly matter most to jurisdictions like ours. The IMF and FSB joint Synthesis Paper of 2023 2 also recognised that EMDEs face a distinct and amplified set of vulnerabilities. In its 2025 Annual Economic Report, the BIS points out that stablecoins fail the basic tests of singleness, elasticity, and integrity that any form of money must meet and are hence structurally unsuitable to anchor a monetary system. The asymmetrical risks to EMDEs often does not receive the importance it merits. Stablecoins are borderless instruments operating in a world of borders. If one jurisdiction with a liberal capital account allows unrestricted use of stablecoins, and they circulate widely in a neighbouring country with capital controls, the financial stability of the latter can be fundamentally undermined. Issues critical to the stability of EMDEs are often acknowledged but not prioritised. So, what does all this mean for a country like India? How should we deal with stablecoins and safeguard financial stability and monetary sovereignty? These questions naturally lead us to consider the domestic policy imperatives that must guide India's approach in this evolving global environment. VII. Policy Approach for India – Promote CBDCs - Harness Innovation and Protect Stability For India, the approach to stablecoins must be guided by caution and an appreciation of domestic imperatives. Stablecoins can undermine trust in the currency and finance system. India already benefits from a payments landscape that is highly efficient, reliable, and robust. Systems such as UPI, RTGS, and NEFT provide fast, low-cost, and secure payment capabilities to millions of users. This leaves little justification for their integration into the financial system, even before considering the broader risks they pose. India's policy on stablecoins must be driven by domestic priorities. At the same time, India must acknowledge the promise of innovation that technologies such as blockchain and tokenisation bring. A central pillar of this strategy is the adoption and cross-border readiness of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are digital tokens like stablecoins yet they are inherently superior since they satisfy all the attributes that money should have – fiat, single, trusted and representing value - and do not pose many of the risks associated with stablecoins. They can perform all the functions stablecoins claim to offer such as programmability, atomic settlement, lower cross-border frictions, while being fully anchored within the existing financial system. Encouraging CBDC use domestically is essential and can be done by making CBDC functionally similar to physical cash, especially with respect to tiered anonymity. For example, ensuring anonymity for small-value CBDC transactions, much like cash, would provide users comfort and trust while preserving safeguards for high-value flows. Such an approach also avoids disintermediation risks for the banking system. The cross-border dimension is even more critical. Much of the appeal of stablecoins lies in their promise of cheaper, faster international transfers. But the same efficiency can be achieved through bilateral or multilateral CBDC corridors. This is an area where India can play a shaping role, by helping build the case for interoperable CBDC arrangements among emerging markets and beyond. A third pillar of India's approach should be the interlinking of fast payment systems (FPS). Interlinking domestic FPS directly contributes to the G20 objectives of faster, cheaper, more accessible and transparent cross-border payments. The recent linkages between UPI and several partner jurisdictions are important steps forward, increasingly reducing the need for any private digital alternatives for remittances. Finally, as we weigh policy choices, we must also address a central argument often made by proponents of stablecoins who claim that the associated risks can be managed through regulation. Regulation can indeed mitigate some risks, but the larger question remains: Can we afford to experiment with the foundations of global monetary and financial stability that have been carefully built over the years for instruments that lack the safety features of money, that are inherently risky and that remain untested at scale? As highlighted in the BIS Annual Economic Report 2025 3 , society faces a clear choice which is either to strengthen the monetary system using proven foundations of trust and advanced, programmable technologies, or to risk repeating the hard lessons of history by relying on unsound private digital currencies with real societal costs. VIII. Conclusion We have seen that stablecoins lack the basic attributes of money, their advantages are neither unique nor unambiguous and their risks are all too real. It may be noted we have not referred to the risks associated with the assets that back a stablecoin. That is because it does not matter, for either the benefits or the risks of stablecoins to materialise. In fact, the bigger threat is a stablecoin that works well. India stands at a decisive policy crossroads. Despite India having good macroeconomic conditions and sound policies, the domestic factors and compulsions must be considered when evaluating policy options for stablecoins. The choices made today will impact the future of our monetary system and financial sector integrity. India's strategy must be clear and coherent, anchored in four key principles: Preserve trust in the national currency, monetary and payment system Preserve trust in the national currency, monetary and payment system Safeguard monetary sovereignty and macro-financial stability Safeguard monetary sovereignty and macro-financial stability Encourage responsible innovation through CBDCs and interoperable payment systems, and Encourage responsible innovation through CBDCs and interoperable payment systems, and Ensure that innovation strengthens, rather than bypasses, the regulated financial system. I will end with my response to the question posed in the title of this speech. Do stablecoins serve a purpose? It seems to me that they do not; at any rate, they do not serve a purpose that cannot be served better by fiat money.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Introduction Good morning, everyone. It's great to be here at the Liberty Science Center, home of the largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Typically, this would be the perfect opportunity for me to discuss the star variables in economics. Alas, I'll save that for the Q&A. Instead, I'm going to talk to you today about the U.S. economy and how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. I'll also discuss recent actions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and I'll give my economic outlook. Before I go further, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System. Turning the Corner One of the important parts of my job is to travel throughout the Federal Reserve's Second District. It gives me the opportunity to meet with business, community, and government leaders and get a firsthand and in-depth look at the challenges and opportunities facing our region. In recent years, North Jersey has largely followed the trajectory of the broader U.S. economy: It was hit hard by the pandemic, rebounded quickly, grappled with inflation, and then, over the past year, faced heightened uncertainty stemming from geopolitical events and changes in trade policy. In fact, if I had to choose one word to describe 2025, it is uncertainty. What's striking is that despite all the uncertainty, the U.S. economy has shown considerable resilience and looks poised to pick up steam next year. In other words, after navigating through the challenges of 2025, we now appear to be turning the corner. Of course, there's always uncertainty about the road ahead-or, as we say in Jersey, about what's coming down the Turnpike. But over the past year, our local, national, and even global economies have proven to be resilient. Here, that resilience is called ""Jersey Strong."" Temporarily Stalled Before I talk about what I expect for the economy, I want to take a few minutes to tell you more about its current state. I'll focus on the two sides of the Fed's dual mandate: maximum employment and price stability. I'll start with price stability, which the FOMC defines as 2 percent inflation 1 over the longer run. In monetary policy, we rely on the totality of the data-and there is a lot of data. While we haven't had the normal flow of official data in recent months due to the government shutdown, we are able to use a wide array of indicators to monitor how the economy is doing. What the data tell me is that the effects of trade policies have boosted inflation this year, but these effects have been more muted and drawn out than I originally anticipated. As a result of the tariffs, progress toward the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run inflation goal has temporarily stalled, with the most recent inflation reading of about 2-3/4 percent roughly unchanged from a year ago. While it is not possible to precisely measure the effects of trade policy actions, my estimate is that they have contributed around one half of a percentage point to the current inflation rate. I do not see any signs of tariffs contributing to second-round or other spillover effects on inflation. In particular, no broad-based supply chain bottlenecks have emerged, shelter inflation has declined steadily, and measures of wage growth point to a continued gradual slowing. This is consistent with reports from around the Second District, where several of my business contacts have noted that, while tariffs continue to drive up their input costs, the pace of price increases has eased slightly. Most importantly, inflation expectations remain well anchored. The New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) continues to show that inflation expectations remain well within their pre-Covid ranges. 2 This is something I watch closely, because well-anchored expectations are critical to ensuring low and stable inflation. Gradual Cooling Turning to the employment side of our mandate, the data show that the labor market has continued to cool, with labor demand softening more than supply. Job growth has been anemic, and the unemployment rate has moved up steadily in recent months. These trends are also occurring in North Jersey, where we've seen slight declines in employment since January, and where many of our regional contacts, including those responding to our business surveys, are reporting job losses. In addition, survey-based measures of the balance between demand and supply show increasing slack in the labor market. In the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey, a measure of the difference between the share of respondents who think jobs are plentiful and the share of those who think jobs are hard to get has declined throughout 2025. We have seen a similar pattern with the National Federation of Independent Business's survey measure of the difficulty in filling jobs. And the SCE's ""job security gap"" measure-defined as respondents' job-finding expectations minus their job-loss expectations-has fallen considerably this year. Many labor market indicators are now at levels we saw prior to the pandemic, a time when the market was not overheated. And although the labor market is clearly cooling, I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration. Monetary Policy and the Road Ahead Looking ahead, it is imperative that we restore inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis. It is equally important to do so without creating undue risks to our maximum employment goal. My assessment is that in recent months, the downside risks to employment have increased as the labor market has cooled, while the upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat. Monetary policy is very focused on bringing these risks into balance. To that end, the FOMC has moved the modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy toward neutral. At its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. The accompanying FOMC statement said that ""in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."" 3 With these actions, monetary policy is well positioned as we head into 2026. Looking ahead, I expect tariffs will have a largely one-off price level effect that will be fully realized in 2026. I anticipate inflation to decline to just under 2-1/2 percent next year before reaching the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent goal in 2027. I expect real GDP growth to be about 2-1/4 percent in 2026, well above my forecast for this year's pace of around 1-1/2 percent. This pickup is in part due to the effects of the government shutdown, but it's also fueled by tailwinds from fiscal policy, favorable financial conditions, and increased investments in artificial intelligence. And I expect the unemployment rate to rise to around 4-1/2 percent at the end of this year, reflecting some additional effects from the government shutdown. With my forecast of above-trend GDP growth, I expect the unemployment rate to gradually come down over the next few years. Balance Sheet Before I conclude, I'd like to briefly comment on the Fed's balance sheet. On December 1, the FOMC stopped reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. 4 With the level of bank reserves now deemed to be ample, the FOMC decided to initiate reserve management purchases to maintain an ample level of reserves. This is the natural next step in the implementation of our ample reserves framework to ensure effective interest rate control. 5 With the steady decline in the level of reserves, we have observed upward pressure on repo rates at times in recent months. 6 When this occurs, the Fed's standing repo operations can act as a shock absorber by capping pressures on money market rates resulting from strong liquidity demand or market stress. 7 I fully expect that standing repo operations will continue to be actively used in this way. Conclusion So, after a year of uncertainty, we will be starting 2026 from a place of resilience. The economy is poised to return to solid growth and price stability. But, as 2025 has shown, the road may shift in unpredictable ways. In assessing the future path of monetary policy, my views, as always, will be based on the evolution of the totality of the data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks to the achievement of our maximum employment and price stability goals. We must be ready to adjust our route as needed to reach our destination. 1 As measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index (Bureau of Economic Analysis). 2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Survey of Consumer Expectations (November 2025). 3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement , December 10, 2025. 4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement , October 29, 2025. 5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization , January 30, 2019; Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet , January 26, 2022; and Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet , May 4, 2022. 6 Roberto Perli, Money Market Conditions and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet , Remarks at 2025 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York City, November 12, 2025. 7 John C.

Central bank visuals across five continents In today’s world, a wealth of information meets with a poverty of attention.

(2025) “Googling ‘inflation’: Household inflation attention across the euro area”, European Journal of Political Economy , Vol. 89. For decades, central banks in many countries have tried to remedy the lack of financial literacy and the “rational inattention” of their populations by offering basic education on how the economy and currencies work.

Join us on a voyage around the globe to see some examples of how central bankers use visuals to get their messages across. We first head south, far away from the ECB’s hometown of Frankfurt – to Uganda in East Africa. Since 2021 the Bank of Uganda has been publishing “ Monetary Policy Statements – At a Glance ”. The short visual summaries of its bimonthly decisions are paired with plain-language explanations (Figure 1). To ensure its policy messages are heard, the bank also publishes a version in Luganda, the country’s most widely spoken local language. As two out of three Ugandans work in agriculture, the visuals often include symbols of local commodities such as coffee. Excerpt from Bank of Uganda’s “Monetary Policy Statement’s – At a Glance” Source: “Monetary Policy Statements – At a Glance”, May 2025. 3,000 kilometers further south-west, the Bank of Namibia publishes presentations to accompany its monetary policy statements (Figure 2). The presentations cover the policy decision of the day, as well as other aspects of the current environment that matter to people, like currency issuance or the gold market.

A day’s flight east, the Bank of Japan (日本銀行or Nippon Ginkō) has embraced visuals to communicate its current policy decisions. Since 2022 it has been offering a visual, plain-language companion to its quarterly ‘Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices’. The Bank’s designers have a keen eye on what resonates most with the Japanese, for instance their shared passion for baseball (Figure 3).

Leaving Tokyo and heading to Manila, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas with its “ MPR Snapshots ” offers the public non-technical visual summaries, in addition to its expert-focused monetary policy reports (Figure 4). These are published in four languages: English, Filipino as well as the regional languages Cebuano and Ilokano and seek to make policy decisions relatable to people’s lives.

Crossing the equator now, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in Wellington is one of the pioneers of layered monetary policy communication, combining both text and visuals. Since the introduction in 2018 of its “ Monetary Policy Snapshots ”, the Bank has dropped the flashy title, but continues to use visuals to explain the local economy. The Bank builds on icons to structure the background material for its quarterly rate decisions (Figure 5). It also offers an interactive chart , which enables readers to follow past rate decisions as well as the future outlook.

Across the Pacific, we see similar approaches, for example by Banco Central de Chile , which has been offering the wider public a snapshot of its Monetary Policy Report since 2022 (Figure 6). Excerpt from Banco Central de Chile’s Monetary Policy Report Snapshot Source: Monetary Policy Report, September 2025. Banco Central de Paraguay followed suit in 2023 (Figure 7). Both central banks use illustrations paired with plain language to explain economic developments to make the policy decisions easier to grasp for the wider public.

On the North American mainland, visuals play only a minor role in communicating monetary policy. The opposite is true for the Bank of Jamaica. Famous for its creative communications – especially its reggae song about the importance of inflation – the Bank uses videos which are televised by national broadcaster TJ to explain economic developments. The series “Inflation Watch” informs viewers of monthly price movements that influence the Bank of Jamaica’s rate decisions (Figure 8), but it often covers other topics, too, such as payments.

Moving back across the Atlantic to Europe, the Bank of England has been leading the global charge in visual policy communications. The Bank’s trailblazing short visual summaries pair intelligible icons with core messages of its Monetary Policy Report (Figure 9). Excerpt from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Report Source: Monetary Policy Report, August 2025. Coming to the end of our journey, which naturally could only offer a few glimpes of central banks’ visual communications across the globe, we arrive back home in Frankfurt. The ECB went through a sea change of its policy communication with the 2021 review of its monetary policy strategy. As part of a larger modernisation package, the ECB explicitly committed to offering the wider public “layered and visualised versions of monetary policy communication”. “Our monetary policy statement at a glance” combines intuitive visuals with accessible messages about what the ECB decided and how its sees the economy evolving (Figure 10). It is available in all 24 EU languages. To expand its reach, the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem share it via their websites and social media. While an average of around 1,800 users read the monetary policy statement on the ECB’s website on press conference day, close to 15,000 people use Instagram to access the Governing Council’s decisions. Excerpt from the ECB’s Visual Monetary Policy Statement Source: “Our monetary policy statement at a glance”, September 2025. What have we learnt from our journey? Clearly, visuals are no guarantee that people will pay attention, or have a lasting understanding of the message. And not everyone is convinced that pictures really help communication – yet. But visual evidence from more and more central banks all over the world points in one direction: it’s time to picture it!

For media queries, please contact Benoit Deeg , tel.: +49 69 1344 95686 In this press release ""corporations"" refers to non-financial corporations (sector S.11 in the European System of Accounts 2010, or ESA 2010), ""households"" refers to households and non-profit institutions serving households (ESA 2010 sectors S.14 and S.15) and ""banks"" refers to monetary financial institutions except central banks and money market funds (ESA 2010 sector S.122). The composite cost-of-borrowing indicators are described in the article entitled ""Assessing the retail bank interest rate pass-through in the euro area at times of financial fragmentation"" in the August 2013 issue of the ECB's Monthly Bulletin (see Box 1). For these indicators, a weighting scheme based on the 24-month moving averages of new business volumes has been applied, in order to filter out excessive monthly volatility. For this reason the developments in the composite cost-of-borrowing indicators in both tables cannot be explained by the month-on-month changes in the displayed subcomponents. Furthermore, the table on bank interest rates for corporations presents a subset of the series used in the calculation of the cost-of-borrowing indicator. Interest rates on new business are weighted by the size of the individual agreements. This is done both by the reporting agents and when the national and euro area averages are computed. Thus changes in average euro area interest rates for new business reflect, in addition to changes in interest rates, changes in the weights of individual countries' new business for the instrument categories concerned. The ""interest rate effect"" and the ""weight effect"" presented in this press release are derived from the Bennet index, which allows month-on-month developments in euro area aggregate rates resulting from changes in individual country rates (the ""interest rate effect"") to be disentangled from those caused by changes in the weights of individual countries' contributions (the ""weight effect""). Owing to rounding, the combined ""interest rate effect"" and the ""weight effect"" may not add up to the month-on-month developments in euro area aggregate rates. In addition to monthly euro area bank interest rate statistics for November 2025, this press release incorporates revisions to data for previous periods. Hyperlinks in the main body of the press release lead to data that may change with subsequent releases as a result of revisions. Unless otherwise indicated, these euro area statistics cover the EU Member States that had adopted the euro at the time to which the data relate. As of reference period December 2014, the sector classification applied to bank interest rates statistics is based on the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). In accordance with the ESA 2010 classification and as opposed to ESA 95, the non-financial corporations sector (S.11) now excludes holding companies not engaged in management and similar captive financial institutions.",html,2026-01-07 09:44:47,,,,,

This year, France is taking on the G7 Presidency, with a number of priorities – addressing global imbalances but also delivering practical progress on six financial stability items: cross-border payments, NBFI, cybersecurity, AI, quantum technology and climate-related risks. It is therefore my pleasure to introduce today’s stimulating sessions dedicated to the challenges of digital innovation and the consequences for the International Monetary System (IMS). Let me first outline two major disruptions, a fast-moving technological one and a slow-moving geopolitical one – to quote Governor Panetta’s recent speech i – (1), before sharing with you a triangle of three objectives, three “S’s” that should guide us in the transition to a new global landscape for payments (2). 1. Two major disruptions are affecting the international monetary landscape 1.1. A technological disruption The first disruption is technological: financial innovations have the potential to reshape the IMS. Among them, tokenisation ii is accelerating end-to-end transaction execution and reducing costs, notably through “smart contracts”. It can revolutionise cross-border payments and possibly domestic payments. Tokenisation could affect the IMS through two opposite forces iii . On the one hand, it may reinforce the US dollar’s centrality with a potentially rapid development of stablecoins iv in USD held outside the United States. Supported by a resilient US financial sector and actively promoted by the US administration, stablecoins – 99% USD-backed so far – could reach a market capitalisation of between USD 500 billion and USD 2 trillion by 2028 according to some projections. v",html,2026-01-07 11:53:46,,,,,

The survey is for the reference period October – December 2025 (Q3:2025-26). The Reserve Bank has been conducting the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector on a quarterly basis since 2008. The information collected in the survey includes quantitative data on new orders received during the reference quarter, backlog of orders at the beginning of the quarter, pending orders at the end of the quarter, total inventories with a breakup between ﬁnished goods (FG), work-in-progress (WiP) and raw material (RM) inventories at the end of the quarter, item-wise production in terms of quantity and value during the quarter vis-à-vis the installed capacity from the targeted group and the reasons for changes in production / installed capacity during the quarter. The level of capacity utilisation (CU) is estimated from these responses. The survey provides valuable input for monetary policy formulation. The survey findings are released on the website of the Bank regularly . During this quarter, selected manufacturing companies will be approached by the Bank. Other manufacturing companies may also participate in the survey by downloading the survey questionnaire from the Reserve Bank’s website https://www.rbi.org.in . The survey questionnaire is placed under the head ‘ Forms ’ (available under the ‘More Links’ at the bottom of the home page) and sub-head ‘ Survey ’. The duly authenticated filled-in survey schedule may be e-mailed as per contact details provided in the survey schedule. Company level data are treated as confidential and never disclosed.

The size of anticipated investment needs will require firms to shift the source of financing from operating cash flows to debt, with private credit playing a rapidly increasing role. While macroeconomic and financial stability risks from the AI boom appear moderate, the boom's sustainability hinges on AI firms meeting high earnings expectations. The fact that equity prices have run far ahead of debt market pricing underscores this tension.",html,2026-01-07 11:45:37,,,,,

Bowman At the California Bankers Association Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach, California (virtual) I would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today. 1 Throughout my now seven years as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I have found that direct outreach with bankers has been the most effective way to learn about and understand your perspectives on improving the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and on local banking and economic conditions. It has now been seven months since I was appointed by President Trump as Vice Chair for Supervision. It is an incredible honor and a profound responsibility to serve in this role. Since I first joined the Board in November 2018, we have faced significant challenges in the banking system and in the economy. Serving on the Board during this time has provided a unique perspective about the banking system and specifically this role, including how to effectively carry out its important responsibilities and promote the safety and soundness of the banking system. Over the past seven months, I have implemented a comprehensive approach to pragmatic supervision and regulation. As we work to preserve safety and soundness, we must ensure the U.S. banking system remains efficient, innovative, and accessible. This is especially important for the small and community banks that serve Americans across the country, including my hometown in Kansas. Drawing from my own experience as a community banker and as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner, I have prioritized tailoring our approach to reflect the unique profiles of banks, refocusing our supervision on early detection and remediation of material financial risks and enhancing transparency in our processes. You know these risks wellâthey are the core risks that truly threaten the viability and safety and soundness of institutions and the stability of the broader financial system. The past seven years as a Governor have also profoundly shaped my approach to this role. They provided an invaluable, front-row perspective on the evolution of supervisory policy, the internal deliberations of the Board, and the real-world impact of our decisions on banks of all sizes. I observed first-hand how certain regulatory and supervisory practicesâwhich may be well-intendedâcan drift to focus on subjective, politicized, or tangential issues that divert our attention from the risks that materially impact safety and soundness and financial stability. Leveraging these experiences allows me to explain not just what we are changing, but why ârooting reforms in observed outcomes rather than abstract theory. This approach bridges Washington policymaking with Main Street banking, ensuring that our supervisory and regulatory framework reflects lessons learned and prioritizes what truly matters for safety and soundness and financial stability. Progress in Supervisory and Regulatory Modernization Since June of last year, we have significantly advanced on the agenda I laid out in my Georgetown University speech. 2 While we have made a great deal of progress in just a few months' time, today, I would like to focus on a few of these priorities. Beginning with properly targeted supervision. Supervision is a powerful instrument for promoting safety and soundness. It enables examiners to rigorously assess institutions and detect any material weaknesses requiring remediation. Every institution is distinctâwith respect to its products and services, geographic presence, market position, and the specific risks it poses. Supervision is one of our most valuable diagnostic tools. It requires a balanced approach, tough decisions, and reasoned judgement. What is the scope of the examination? Which risks should be prioritized? Are there new or emerging risks that require additional review? To be effective in promoting safety and soundness and U.S. financial stability, supervision must focus on the most important risksâwhich are the core and material financial risks. In late October 2025, for the first time, the Federal Reserve published supervisory operating principles designed to enhance supervisory transparency and accountability and sharpen our examination processes. 3 These principles direct supervisory staff to identify and require early remediation of material financial risks. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) exposed critical flaws in our prior supervisory approach, which became an ever-expanding scope of unfocused activities that led examiners and the bank to overlook or downplay severe interest-rate and liquidity risks that triggered the bank's collapse and eroded broader public confidence. As I have said a number of times in the past, significant lessons remain from the SVB episode, and we are committed to identifying and rigorously addressing them. Turning back to the operating principles, since their introduction, we have made significant progress in their implementation, including through question and answer sessions with leaders and staff throughout the Federal Reserve System, both at the Board and the Reserve Banks; providing illustrative examples to demonstrate how they should be applied in different circumstances, which we will add to over time; hosting conversations and answering questions from Supervision leaders and staff; and soliciting feedback from regulated firms. If we discover areas that should have been included but were not covered in the initial set of principles, or if we find that there is confusion or misunderstanding about how they should be applied we will refine our approach. We have also made an important change to the LFI ratings framework that applies to the largest banks. The changes ensure that the ""well-managed"" status of a firm is reflective of its overall ratings and risk, rather than disproportionately weighting a single supervisory component to drive this overall assessment of the firm. While this is an important step, we recognize that there is more work to be done on bank ratings frameworks, which I will discuss shortly. We have also eliminated the use of ""reputational risk"" in the supervisory process. In the past, this imprecise supervisory tool has been misused to prohibit politically disfavored activities. And in furtherance of our focus on core and material financial risks, we have rescinded the climate guidance that diverted supervisory resources away from risks that are material to the safety and soundness of banks. This guidance forced institutions to devote excessive resources to collecting climate-related data from customers and prospective customers, and to forecast business risks beyond any reasonable or reliable forecasting window, potentially decades into the futureâall to address risks that banks are already required to manage. In short, these climate principles did little to further our statutory objectives to protect safety and soundness and financial stability. Banking inherently involves risk. The regulatory framework aims not to eliminate risk, but to ensure the safe and sound management of risk. With proper prioritization, regulators and examiners can foster robust risk management while enabling banks to innovate, grow, and serve their customers, communities, and the broader U.S. economy. Since the mortgage crisis more than 15 years ago, bank regulation has been implemented under an overly granular ""more-is-better"" approach that has driven significant banking activity out of the regulated system and into less-supervised corners of the financial landscape. This framework is long overdue for a comprehensive review. An unfocused, process-heavy approach to regulation and supervision leaves banks less able to support economic activity, displaces activity into unregulated sectors, and ultimately makes the overall financial system less safe and stable. In recent months, we have introduced meaningful improvements, including publishing several proposals for public comment, and finalizing several critical reforms. We have proposed re-calibrating the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) to the statutory minimum to provide greater flexibility to eligible community banks. This would change the required level of capital for community banks electing the CBLR from 9 percent to 8 percent, a level that is still nearly double the required Tier 1 leverage ratio and preserves a strong capital foundation for these firms. The CBLR allows a community bank to choose to meet a single leverage capital requirement instead of the risk-based measures designed for larger banks. In addition to meeting the statutory capital requirement, it enables more community banks to take advantage of the relief that Congress intended. We look forward to receiving comments and ultimately finalizing the proposed revisions. We have also modified the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), returning it to its traditional role as a leverage-based backstop to risk-based capital requirements. In doing so, we are making real progress to enhance the stability of the U.S. Treasury market by enhancing intermediation capacity for large bank-affiliated broker-dealers. In addition, we are in the process of revising and enhancing the stress testing program to reduce year-over-year volatility, improve the reliability and accuracy of the models, and increase transparency. And in the coming days and weeks, the Board will announce additional regulatory changes to improve the fairness, transparency, and prioritization of the supervisory process. The Path Forward: Bank Regulatory and Supervisory Reforms While I hope that you are already seeing the benefits of these initial modernization efforts, there are a number of additional initiatives underway that will materially improve the bank regulatory framework for all sizes of banksâespecially for community banks. Improving Supervision â Memorializing Changes in Regulation Staff will soon conclude several regulatory proposals that will guide our supervisory work. The first proposal would define what constitutes ""unsafe and unsound"" practices for supervision and enforcement activities. The second removes ""reputation risk"" from the supervisory process. These proposals will largely align with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposals, and are intended to demonstrate the Federal Reserve's commitment to transparency, fairness, and efficiency, which are the core principles I have supported for many years. Updating and Indexing Asset Thresholds Bank supervision and regulation applies based on the categorization of banks into ""portfolios,"" which are based on a combination of fixed statutory and regulatory thresholds. Many of these portfolios rely on only a single, fixed asset level, like the definition of a community bank at $10 billion or a large bank at $100 billion. This type of definition relies only on the bank's asset size regardless of its activities, business model, or risk profile. Among many other shortcomings, this approach does not account for economic growth and inflation over time. As a result, firms with stable growth, consistent business models, and no change in risk profile end up crossing asset thresholds and becoming subject to increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. While asset thresholds for portfolios play a significant role in the supervisory process, there are a wide range of thresholds that impact banks across the regulatory and statutory frameworks. Looking ahead, we will reconsider these regulatory thresholds and will work to support Congress in updating thresholds that have become outdated and too low relative to the broader economy. A simple solution would be to adjust thresholds by nominal GDP, which includes both economic growth and inflation. Doing so will result in a more robust and resilient system over time, proactively integrating indexed changes into the framework. It may also be worth considering whether single-metric thresholds, like those based purely on asset size, are the most effective way to align statutory, regulatory, and supervisory requirements with the underlying risk of the activity, or whether a more nuanced approach may be appropriate. For example, a more nuanced approach could consider things like business model and risk profile as inputs. I look forward to working with Congress and my regulatory colleagues to address these and other opportunities to update the regulatory framework. I also support taking a comprehensive approach to indexing statutory requirements broadly across all financial agency authorities, including for requirements that I did not directly reference in my remarks today. Supervisory Portfolios In several speeches over the past few years, I have outlined considerations for a more effective approach to supervising community banks. 4 This would require better aligning our supervisory approach to the complexity and risk profile of smaller institutions. Community banks should be subject to strict supervisory oversight, but it must be commensurate with their smaller size, simpler business activities, and the modest risks they pose to U.S. financial stability. This could be accomplished by separating the community bank oversight program from those designed for larger and regional banks, focusing examiner attention on small bank risks and activities. This would also eliminate the temptation to ""push down"" standards and expectations to community banks, that were designed for larger and more complex institutions. Material Financial Risk To avoid confusion, it may also be helpful to clarify what is meant by identifying material financial risks in the supervisory process. It does not mean focusing primarily on checking boxes in reviewing processes, procedures, and documentation, regardless of the assessment of risk. It also does not mean ignoring other aspects of the established supervisory program. As the supervisory operating principles note, focusing on material financial risks requires examiners to use reasoned judgment to prioritize through every stage of an examination. This begins with targeting in the pre-examination letter, the examination's scope of work, and differentiating between findings that meet the threshold of a matter requiring attention, and those that can be addressed through less formal means. The operating principles specifically reference supervisory observations for those matters that do not rise to the level of a violation but may be included in an examination report. Reducing Overlap in Examinations In conducting holding company supervision, the Federal Reserve is required by statute to rely ""to the fullest extent possible"" on examinations performed by a subsidiary bank's primary state or federal supervisors. In practice, complying with this requirement imposes significant limits on the Fed's supervisory activities. This applies to national banks regulated by the OCC and state non-member banks regulated by the FDIC and a state banking regulator. 5 The requirement is designed to avoid redundant and burdensome examination processes. However, to be effective, the Fed must have confidence in the supervisory processes and outcomes of these OCC, FDIC, and state banking agency exams, which requires access to and a thorough review of examination reports and activities. Where it is not possible to rely on or we do not have access to an exam or supporting documentation of supervisory activity, we may need to conduct our own review. Reports of Examination and Supervisory Ratings Each bank examination concludes with a report of examination. This report documents exam findings including any supervisory observations or criticisms, and matters requiring attention (MRAs) or matters requiring immediate attention (MRIAs), if any are found during the exam. The report also includes the bank's supervisory ratings according to the CAMELS rating system. 6 Exam findings and the inclusion of specific matters in the report can have serious consequences for the bank. In addition to directing how banks prioritize their efforts to remediate identified issues, the bank's CAMELS rating can influence whether the bank qualifies to receive favorable treatment of banking applications, affect the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, affect the cost of liquidity funding, and serve as an indication of bank management performance for its board of directors. The supervisory operating principles emphasize that examination findings and reports must focus on material financial risk. We are currently implementing several initiatives to reflect this approach including: revisiting the standard for issuing MRAs and MRIAs; ensuring that CAMELS ratings reflect a bank's risk profile and financial condition, including that the ""M"" for management is assessed on measurable factors; and reviving the use of non-binding supervisory ""observations,"" which identify matters of note that do not rise to the level of an MRA or MRIA. Although supervisory observations are not ""binding"" on the firm, in the sense that they do not require formal remediation, these informal communications are valuable for early identification of issues that may grow to become potential concerns. They also encourage constructive communication and feedback between examiners and bank management. Reporting and Applications Our work to modernize the frameworks also includes reporting and applications, especially for community banks. The obligation to provide data or other information, including through quarterly bank ""call reports"" creates a disproportionate burden on community banks. Often, regulators and supervisors do not review the information and data that is submitted. This presents an opportunity to revisit these data collections in a rigorous review that would ensure that each collection remains relevant and necessary for supervisory purposes, including whether there are lower-cost and less burdensome alternatives available. This certainly is a departure from recent regulatory approaches, in which more is always better, but collecting less information can help us to ensure we are focused on collecting the right and most valuable information. Revisiting our long-standing processes will help us to understand whether we have struck the right balance. Refining our approach to data collection can make a meaningful difference in reducing burden while also maintaining robust oversight and high standards. Like all banks, community banks often require regulatory approval to engage in some business activities and mergers, or to engage in new activities. The process of applying for regulatory approval has become uncertain, cumbersome, disruptive, and slow. In some cases, application forms may not require a bank to submit the necessary information needed to evaluate an application. The application process may also include standards that make little sense when applied to community banks, like using restrictive screens for evaluating the competitive effects of mergers in rural and underserved communities. In addition, the process often lacks specific action timelines necessary for business planning purposes. Mergers and acquisitions involve coordinating a number of time-dependent processes, including transaction closing and staffing related planning, and the process of scheduling technology integrations with specialized vendors. Missing deadlines can be costly for the institutions involved, and we are currently working to improve this process by addressing these and other challenges, especially for community banks. Transparency Finally, I would like to discuss transparency, which I see as a critical element of the regulatory and supervisory processes. Transparency in supervisory expectations is just as important as transparency in regulatory requirements, and yet it often receives the least scrutiny and attention. In part, the lack of transparency for supervision results from information security rules and how they apply to communication between banks and examiners. These have been protected from public scrutiny under the broad categorization of ""confidential supervisory information"" (CSI). Labeling information as CSI results in significant restrictions on its disclosureâbanks and bank employees are subject to criminal penalties if they disclose CSI without regulatory approval even if doing so would serve beneficial purposes for bank safety and soundness. When banks share the latest information about fraud prevention among themselvesâif some of the data is currently classified as CSIâthe disclosure can be prohibited, even if sharing it could make all banks more resilient to emerging fraud risks. Likewise, bank regulators dedicate a great deal of time and effort to reviewing bank cyber risk profiles and controls, and yet opportunities for collaboration and sharing can be limited by the fear that sharing CSI could result in criminal penalties. These examples demonstrate how expansive the definition of CSI has become. The vague and over-broad definition and interpretation of CSI effectively prohibit constructive speech and information sharing. In addition to limiting valuable uses of information sharing, the limits can also serve to shield abusive supervisory behaviors. To address these weaknesses, we are reviewing approaches to better define or create circumstances in which CSI can be shared, including through creating limited use cases exempt from the definition of CSI. In another initiative to increase transparency, in December, we finally published a copy of the LISCC Operating Manual, which is one of the manuals used by Board and Reserve Bank staff to supervise the largest and most complex banks. 7 We plan to release the remaining LISCC administrative manuals in the coming weeks and months. The public release of these manuals is just the beginning of our efforts to increase the transparency of our administrative processes. We are working to identify other manuals and guidance to further enhance transparency and provide public accountability for our supervisory processes. Even though these documents are internally focused, they can give banks and the broader public insight into supervisory operations and expectations. Closing Thoughts As we continue our work to modernize the bank regulatory framework and our supervisory approach, I look forward to engaging with our stakeholders for feedback. Informal conversations, round table discussions and attending conferences like this one are helpful to achieve this goal. It also allows us to better understand the real-world consequences of our work. Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss our work with you today. 1.

The increase was primarily attributable to tax and services receipts, government's global sukuk issuance, coupled with government's foreign loan withdrawal. The position of official reserve assets at the end of December 2025 was equivalent to 6.4 months of imports or 6.3 months of imports and servicing government's external debt, well above the international adequacy standard of around three months of imports. Bank Indonesia considers that the current level of official reserve assets is adequate to underpin external sector resilience while also buttressingmacroeconomic and financial system stability. Moving forward, Bank Indonesia views that external sector resilience will remain well maintained, supported by an adequate level of official reserve assets and continued foreign capital inflows, in line with positive investor perceptions of Indonesia's economic outlook and attractive investment returns. Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen synergy with the Government towards bolstering external resilience, thereby safeguarding economic stability to support sustainable economic growth.

Under his leadership, AFR helped reinforce the Fund’s role as a trusted partner to our African members. During his tenure, the Fund also added a 25th chair to its Executive Board, increasing the voice of sub-Saharan Africa. “Abe championed tailored policy advice and capacity development for sub-Saharan Africa, deepened engagement in key countries, and helped roll out additional resources to support fragile and conflict-affected states. He also modernized AFR’s operations, strengthened collaboration across departments on critical issues such as debt resolution, PRGT financing, and resilience to shocks, and helped steer the evolving capacity development delivery to the region. His strategic vision and gift for diplomacy have left an enduring mark on the Fund. “I am deeply grateful for Abe’s visionary leadership, dedication to the Fund’s mission, and unwavering commitment to the members in the region,” said Ms. Georgieva. ""The legacy he leaves on the Fund’s work in Africa is one of alignment with the aspirations of people, especially the youth, for good governance, strong economies and lasting prosperity. His trusted advice has been invaluable to me personally, and his leadership has strengthened our mission. “A national of Ethiopia, Mr. Selassie first joined the IMF in 1994. Over his remarkable 32-year career, he held senior positions including Deputy Director in AFR, Mission Chief for Portugal and South Africa, Division Chief of the Regional Studies Division, and Senior Resident Representative in Uganda. Earlier, he contributed to programs in Turkey, Thailand, Romania, and Estonia, and worked on policy, operational review, and economic research.""

We use it to monitor developments in the economy and to track businesses’ views.","Monthly Decision Maker Panel data - December 2025 The December DMP survey was conducted between 5 and 19 December 2025 and received 2,062 responses. Firms reported that their realised annual own-price growth fell by 0.1 percentage points to 3.7% in the three months to December. Note that the DMP covers own prices from firms across the whole economy, not just consumer-facing firms. Year-ahead expected own-price inflation was 3.6% in the three months to December, 0.1 percentage points lower than firms reported in the three months to November. Businesses therefore expect output price inflation to fall by 0.1 percentage points over the next year, based on three-month averages. Year-ahead expected CPI inflation was 3.4% in the three months to December. The corresponding measure for three-year-ahead CPI inflation was 2.9%. Both measures have been broadly stable over recent months. Firms reported that annual wage growth was 4.4% in the three months to December, 0.1 percentage point below the three months to November. Expected year-ahead wage growth fell slightly, by 0.1 percentage points to 3.7% in the three months to December. This implies that firms expect their wage growth to decline by 0.7 percentage points over the next 12 months. Firms reported that realised annual employment growth was -0.4% in the three months to December, up from -0.7% in the three months to November. Expectations for employment growth over the next year weakened slightly this month, falling by 0.2 percentage points to -0.4% in the three months to December.

In November, the median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months remained unchanged at 3.1% for the tenth consecutive month. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months also remained unchanged from October, at 2.8%. Expectations for inflation three years ahead were also unchanged at 2.5%, as were inflation expectations for five years ahead at 2.2%. Uncertainty about inflation expectations over the next 12 months also remained unchanged in November. Respondents in lower income quintiles continued to report on average slightly higher inflation perceptions and short-horizon expectations than those in higher income quintiles, a trend observed since 2023. However, the broad evolution of inflation perceptions and expectations remained relatively closely aligned across income groups. Younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 35-54 and 55-70). Income and consumption Consumers’ nominal income growth expectations over the next 12 months remained unchanged at 1.2% in November. Perceived nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months increased to 5.0%, from 4.9% in October. Expected nominal spending growth over the next 12 months decreased to 3.4%, from 3.5% in October, with respondents in the lowest three income quintiles showing slightly higher spending growth expectations than those in the highest two quintiles. Economic growth and labour market Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months became more negative, decreasing to -1.3% in November from -1.1% in October. Expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 10.9% in November, from 11.0% in October. As in previous months, lower-income households expected the highest unemployment rate 12 months ahead (13.4%), while higher-income households expected the lowest rate (9.4%). Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be only slightly higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (10.4%), suggesting a broadly stable labour market outlook. Housing and credit access Consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 3.4% over the next 12 months, which was lower than in October (3.5%). Home price growth expectations remained broadly aligned across income categories, standing at 3.5% and 3.2% for the lowest and highest income quintiles respectively. Expectations for mortgage interest rates over the next 12 months declined to 4.6% in November, from 4.7% in October. As in previous months, lower-income households expected the highest mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead (5.3%), while higher-income households expected the lowest rates (4.1%). The net percentage of households reporting a tightening (relative to those reporting an easing) of access to credit over the previous 12 months declined compared with October, while the net percentage of households expecting tighter credit conditions over the next 12 months remained unchanged. The release of the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) results for December is scheduled for 30 January 2026. For media queries, please contact: Benoit Deeg , tel.: +49 172 1683704. The main aggregate results for individual countries and the euro area are published on the ECB Data Portal and on the ECB’s website every month. Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics presented in this press release refer to the 2% winsorised mean. For further details, see ECB Consumer Expectations Survey – Guide to the computation of aggregate statistics .

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 58G(1)(b) read with Section 58B(5)(aa) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The scrutiny of the company with regard to its digital lending operations was conducted by RBI. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the company's reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The company had obtained a Default Loss Guarantee from Lending Service Provider, which exceeded five per cent of the amount of outstanding loan portfolio. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the company with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company.

f0ceec477cfa3c6b93ccd08430e320c7e066086102688e35a15cbce0119428c9,rss,英国,消息,2026-02-03 10:00:00,Regulators announce first firms to join Scale-up Unit,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2026/february/regulators-announce-first-firms-to-join-scale-up-unit,The Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority have announced the first cohort of banks and building societies to benefit from their joint Scale-up Unit.,"Regulators announce first firms to join Scale-up Unit News release The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have announced the first cohort of banks and building societies to benefit from their joint Scale-up Unit. The Scale-up Unit announced last year is designed to build stronger ties and provide tailored support for fast-growing and innovative financial firms, helping them to grow sustainably at pace. The six firms that expressed interest and have been accepted to the first cohort are: Allica Bank ClearBank Monument Bank Nottingham Building Society OakNorth Bank Zopa Bank These firms will receive support designed to help them navigate the regulatory landscape as they develop new products, attract new customers, and move into new markets. PRA and FCA officials will meet directly with the firms, both as a group and individually, throughout the coming months. This will also help the PRA and FCA better understand scaling firms’ experience of the regulatory process, with the aim of improving regulatory processes for the entire sector to help firms expand and innovate. Charlotte Gerken, Executive Director for UK Deposit Takers at the PRA, said: “Welcoming the first cohort to our Scale-up Unit is an important milestone. It shows our commitment to helping firms grow in a sustainable way that benefits the financial services sector and wider economic growth.” Jessica Rusu, Chief Data, Information and Intelligence Officer at the FCA said: “We look forward to working with the first cohort as we deliver on our strategy to support growth and UK competitiveness. Our joint Scale-Up Unit enhances the support available to firms as they move from start-up to scale up, helping them to grow successfully and sustainably.” The regulators will be open to expressions of interest from a second cohort of firms later this year, with further detail to follow. The Scale-up Unit is also open to requests for support from smaller, fast-growing insurers on an ongoing basis, rather than through a cohort, in line with the criteria set out on the PRA website. The FCA currently supports new and high growth firms through its Early and High Growth Oversight function. They will further enhance their offer by opening expressions of interest for a new solo regulated Scale up cohort in the Spring, supporting firms from a wider range of sectors. Richard Davies, CEO of Allica Bank, said: “Allica are delighted to be included in the initial Scale-up Unit cohort, having led the call for a dedicated regulatory unit to support firms as they scale. The Unit should provide banks like Allica with more capital certainty and more regulatory support to boost lending to the established SMEs that power the UK’s real economy. “Done well, the Scale-up Unit can support the government’s objective to make the UK the location of choice for financial services firms to invest, innovate and grow.” Rishi Khosla, CEO and Co-founder of OakNorth, said: “We’re honoured to be part of the first cohort of the Scale-up Unit. OakNorth was founded to empower breakthrough businesses – profitable and scaling lower-mid-market companies – who are too often overlooked by traditional banks, and this tailored regulatory support will help us better deliver on that mission as we continue to scale. “Having already lent over $21bn to these businesses, supporting the creation of tens of thousands of jobs and homes, we’re delighted to work closely with regulators to build an even stronger platform for sustainable growth.” Notes to editors The Scale-up Unit The Scale-up Unit builds on and complements the regulators’ existing support for early-stage firms, including through the New Bank and Insurer Start-up Units, Regulatory Sandbox, Early and High Growth Oversight function, Pre Application Support Service (PASS), and AI Lab. It recognises the different types of support needed for firms at the next stage of their development. The Scale-up Unit also aligns with changes designed to streamline regulation, including implementing Basel 3.1, Solvency UK, Strong and Simple, and reforms to the Senior Managers Regime. It also aligns with the Office for Investment: Financial Services, which is helping foreign firms enter and adjust to the UK market. Other news Regulators announce first firms to join Scale-up...

While inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it picked up materially in the second half of 2025. The Board has been closely monitoring the economy and judges that some of the increase in inflation reflects greater capacity pressures. As a result, the Board considers that inflation is likely to remain above target for some time. Capacity pressures reflect, in part, the greater momentum in demand seen in recent months. Growth in private demand has strengthened substantially more than expected, driven by both household spending and investment. Activity and prices in the housing market are also continuing to pick up. Financial conditions eased over 2025 and it is uncertain whether they remain restrictive. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses and the effects of earlier interest rate reductions are yet to flow through fully to aggregate demand, prices and wages. More recently, the exchange rate, money market interest rates and government bond yields have risen following a rise in market expectations for the cash rate. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight and that they have stabilised in recent months, in line with the pick-up in momentum in economic activity. The unemployment rate has been a little lower than expected and measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates. Growth in the Wage Price Index has eased from its peak, but broader measures of wages growth continue to be strong and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation and the extent to which monetary policy is restrictive. On the domestic side, if growth in demand is stronger than expected, and growth in the economy’s supply capacity remains limited, it is likely to add further to capacity pressures. Uncertainty in the global economy remains significant but so far there has been little or no depressing effect on the Australian economy; indeed, recent growth and trade in Australia’s major trading partners has surprised on the upside. Decision A wide range of data over recent months have confirmed that inflationary pressures picked up materially in the second half of 2025. While part of the pick-up in inflation is assessed to reflect temporary factors, it is evident that private demand is growing more quickly than expected, capacity pressures are greater than previously assessed and labour market conditions are a little tight. The Board judged that inflation is likely to remain above target for some time and it was appropriate to increase the cash rate target. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Introduction Good evening, everyone, and happy new year to all. I always appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Council on Foreign Relations. 1 I'm looking forward to a robust discussion this evening. You may have read that the words of the year for 2025 were phrases like ""rage-bait,"" ""AI slop,"" and, of course, ""6-7."" I'd add a word of my own. In December, I gave a speech titled ""Resilience."" 2 I said then that despite all the uncertainty posed by trade policy and geopolitical events, the U.S. and global economies showed considerable resilience, continued to grow, and were poised to gain steam in 2026. I'd like to pick up where I left off and talk about what I expect to see this year for the U.S. economy and for monetary policy. Before I continue, allow me to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System. 2026 at a Glance Let me begin by sharing a snapshot of the current state of the economy. While we haven't had the normal flow of official data in recent months due to the government shutdown, these data are now slowly coming in. And many other alternative indicators have augmented the overall picture. Based on the totality of the data, the economic outlook is favorable. GDP growth looks to have been somewhat above 2 percent last year, and it will likely pick up some this year. Although the labor market cooled over the past couple of years, I expect that we'll see it stabilize this year and then strengthen somewhat thereafter. Inflation appears likely to peak sometime in the first half of this year as the full effects of tariffs are felt and then will be poised to move back toward the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal. Clearer View Since I mentioned often used words in 2025, allow me to dive further into a discussion of another word that defined the year: tariffs. As trade policy has evolved and details have become clearer in recent months, estimates of effective tariff rates today are considerably lower than they were last spring. At the same time, the data are providing a clearer picture of the likely effects of tariffs on inflation. Based on granular analysis of the data in hand, we can draw a few conclusions. First, the tariffs have been overwhelmingly borne by domestic businesses and consumers, rather than by foreign producers. Second, the tariffs have already meaningfully increased U.S. prices of imported goods, although the full effects have likely not yet been felt. My current estimate is that the increase in tariffs to date has contributed around one half of a percentage point to the current inflation rate of about 2-3/4 percent. Tariffs aside, underlying inflation trends have been pretty favorable, and we're seeing no signs of broader inflationary pressures. In particular, shelter inflation has continued to decline steadily, no significant supply chain bottlenecks have emerged, and measures of wage growth have moved to levels consistent with low inflation. In addition, inflation expectations remain well anchored. The New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) shows that although short-term expectations have moved up somewhat, medium- and longer-term expectations remain well within their pre-Covid ranges. 3 Most other measures of longer-run inflation expectations tell the same story. This is something I watch closely, because well-anchored expectations are critical to ensuring low and stable inflation. Cooling Labor Market When it comes to employment, the labor market continued to cool during 2025, with labor demand not keeping up with supply. Over the course of last year, the unemployment rate moved up, and ended the year at 4.4 percent. Other survey-based measures of the balance between demand and supply-including from the Conference Board and the National Federation of Independent Business, as well as the New York Fed's SCE-also show increasing slack in the labor market. Many of these labor market indicators are now at levels we saw in the years prior to the pandemic, a time when the labor market was not overheated and inflation was quite low. And although the labor market has clearly cooled, I should emphasize that this has been a gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration. International Similarities We're seeing broadly similar patterns of resilience in many economies around the world, which likewise have navigated the effects of U.S. trade policy uncertainty reasonably well. Because most other countries have not instituted reciprocal tariffs, they have not experienced increased import prices in the same way as in the U.S. Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook With this in mind, I'll now explain how monetary policy is positioned for this year and beyond. I'll also share my outlook for the U.S. economy. It is imperative that we restore inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis. It is equally important to do so without creating undue risks to the Federal Reserve's maximum employment goal. In recent months, the downside risks to employment have increased as the labor market cooled, while the upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat for the reasons that I have already discussed. The actions taken by the FOMC in the latter part of last year have brought these risks into better balance. By reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by a cumulative 75 basis points last year, the FOMC has moved the modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy closer to neutral. Monetary policy is now well positioned to support the stabilization of the labor market and the return of inflation to the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent. My base case for the economic outlook is quite favorable. Looking ahead, I expect tariffs will have a largely one-off effect on prices that will be fully realized this year. As a result, I anticipate inflation will peak at around 2-3/4 to 3 percent sometime during the first half of this year, before starting to fall back. I expect inflation will be just under 2-1/2 percent for this year as a whole, before reaching the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent goal in 2027. I expect the economy to grow above trend this year, with real GDP growth between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent. This pickup from last year's pace is in part due to a first-quarter rebound from the effects of the government shutdown, but it's also fueled by tailwinds from fiscal policy, favorable financial conditions, and increased investments in artificial intelligence. With my forecast of above-trend GDP growth, I expect the unemployment rate to stabilize this year and then gradually come down over the next few years. Of course, there is always uncertainty when looking into the future, so I'll remain data dependent as the year takes shape. As the December FOMC statement said: ""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."" 4 Balance Sheet Before I close, I'd like to briefly comment on the Fed's balance sheet. The FOMC stopped reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at the start of December. 5 With the level of bank reserves deemed to have reached ample levels, the FOMC decided at its December meeting to initiate reserve management purchases to maintain an ample supply of reserves on an ongoing basis. This is the natural next step in the implementation of our ample reserves framework to ensure effective interest rate control, and it in no way reflects a shift in the stance of monetary policy. 6 With the steady decline in the level of reserves, we have observed upward pressure on repo rates at times in recent months. 7 When this occurs, the Fed's standing repo operations can act as a shock absorber by capping pressures on money market rates resulting from strong liquidity demand or market stress. 8 I fully expect that standing repo operations will continue to be actively used in this way and function exactly as designed. In fact, we just saw this in action over year-end when some of the usual market pressures arose. Conclusion It's only January, so I won't speculate about the word of the year for 2026. But the resilience we have been seeing means the economy is poised for solid growth and a return to price stability. That said, it's important not to forget another word frequently heard in 2025: uncertainty. In assessing the future path of monetary policy, my view, as always, will be based on the evolution of the totality of the data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks to the achievement of our maximum employment and price stability goals.

Lunch Jour Fixe, Berlin, 26 January 2026.","Joachim Nagel: Outlook for 2026 in the light of multifaceted challenges worldwide Speech by Dr Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Ambassadors Club e.V. Lunch Jour Fixe, Berlin, 26 January 2026. The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Check against delivery Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure and an honour to be with you today. In the next few minutes, I would like to give you an overview of the economic outlook for Germany from the Bundesbank's perspective. The outlook is closely intertwined with the major and multifaceted challenges that we are facing around the world. I would therefore also like to talk about how we can approach major challenges. What examples and experiences are available from a central bank perspective? 1 Recent economic outlook for Germany The Bundesbank published its latest forecast for Germany about a month ago, shortly before Christmas. 1 According to the forecast, inflation in Germany will continue its way back to 2 % this year. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany is forecast to grow at a rate of 2.2 % in 2026 and around 2 % in 2027 and 2028. That's very good news for all of us: in Germany – as in the euro area – the inflation rate is back towards 2 %, the level at which we want to see it. If we look at economic activity, German gross domestic product grew slightly in 2025 by 0.3 % in calendar-adjusted terms. It will grow somewhat more strongly, by about 0.6 %, in 2026, by 1.3 % in 2027 and by 1.1 % in 2028. From 2026 onwards, the expansionary fiscal stance will clearly support economic growth in Germany. The cumulative overall effect of additional government spending on defence and infrastructure is estimated to contribute 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth by 2028. Furthermore, transfers and tax cuts are expected to boost the incomes of households and firms. Government deficit and debt ratios will rise significantly. Bundesbank experts expect the debt ratio to increase from 62 % in 2024 to 68 % in 2028. Over the same period, the deficit ratio is expected to increase from 2.7 % to 4.8 %. A robust budget plan is needed that will bring the deficit back down in the medium term without cutting back on the relevant infrastructure investment. When using the extended scope for borrowing for defence and infrastructure, fiscal policy should make sure that this borrowing actually does lead to additional investment. And it must also make sure that public finances remain sound in the future. The Bundesbank has made proposals with a view to both these things. 2 We anticipate that fiscal policy will not be the only contributor to GDP growth in Germany. A revival in household demand will also play an important role over the entire forecast horizon. By contrast, we expect business investment to remain dampened by a difficult investment environment owing to cyclical and structural headwinds. It will return to an expansionary path only slowly and later in 2026. German exports are likely to slowly return to an expansion path over the course of 2026 and contribute to GDP growth. However, they are still suffering from higher tariffs and will gain momentum only moderately – and that is without even factoring in the spectre of a further tariff escalation. There are also structural obstacles weighing on competitiveness. 3 At the same time, German imports will rise considerably. Thus, the German current account surplus – as a share of nominal GDP – will decrease over the forecast horizon, from an expected 4.7 % in 2025 to no more than 3.2 % in 2028. Compared with past decades, these figures are remarkably low. To sum up: the German economy will be gradually returning to a recovery path over the course of 2026. 2 Multifaceted challenges worldwide 2.1 International challenges are omnipresent Ladies and gentlemen, It will come as no surprise to you that the outlook and forecast presented are subject to uncertainty. Economic growth could be weaker, inflation could be higher. We are currently facing a broad array of different challenges worldwide. Let me name a few. International trade disputes and geopolitical conflicts shaped developments last year. They played a big part in pushing up uncertainty. It had an impact on cross-border trade relations and exchange rate developments, amongst other things. And unfortunately, as things stand, caution requires us to assume that both geopolitical conflicts and trade disputes are here to stay. Regardless of whether the demands of one NATO member on an ally's territory are withdrawn or not. And there are other challenges, too. We are all witnessing the continued rapid rise of artificial intelligence as it becomes more and more important. The new technology entails great opportunities, but also risks. Digital innovation is also set to revamp the financial system as we have known it. The distributed ledger technology in particular has not only spawned new types of assets. It also challenges the business models of many existing players, promising both gains in efficiency and creating new risks. And of course, climate change and its impact is a challenge for countries and people all over the world. These are four very different examples of challenges all our economies are facing, and the full list of challenges is indeed much longer than this. So we need to ask ourselves: how can we find suitable answers, how can we react, how can we address uncertainty? 2.2 Experience in dealing with international challenges Ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank I have found it always to be worthwhile to look at what has worked before when it comes to dealing with international challenges, and to leverage the experiences gained. First: I firmly believe that global challenges should be dealt with through rules-based international cooperation. Second: we have tried-and-tested institutions and forums for international cooperation. We should make use of them! At present, one gets the impression that ""might is right"". Rules and international cooperation appear to have fallen out of fashion. But blackmail and violence are not the basis for lasting cooperation. Long-term cooperation is made possible through understanding, reliability and compliance with shared rules. Let us remember the financial crisis that started in 2007 in the United States. Cross-border joint work at the international and the European level has since done a lot to make the financial system more resilient. In response to the global financial crisis, the G20 created the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which is based at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The G20 mandated the FSB to deliver the reform agenda and it translates political commitments into international standards. Today it plays a vital role in safeguarding global financial stability by strengthening the resilience of the global financial system. The Bank for International Settlements itself was founded in 1930. That makes it the world's oldest international financial organisation. It plays a key role in the cooperation of central banks and other financial institutions. Another important example: the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It promotes global financial stability and monetary cooperation among the countries in the international monetary system. During the global financial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis, the IMF proved its role as a stabilising anchor by providing financial support, policy guidance and credibility, when it was most needed. And, as a more recent example, the Fund again stepped up its engagement during the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent energy and inflation shocks. It swiftly provided policy advice and extensive financial assistance to many of its members with a view to restoring stability. Alongside these institutions, the G7 and the G20 have served as essential informal forums for dialogue and coordination for many years. I describe these experiences of international cooperation because they are examples of how to deal best with cross-border challenges. Disruptions in the financial system can cause considerable real economic and social costs. Central banks play a key role in preventing and managing such disruptions. And we at the Bundesbank work on a regular basis with all these institutions I have just spoken about, actively contributing in various forums. Our enthusiasm is driven by our unshakable conviction that a world shaped by cooperation is better than a world of confrontation. This also holds for another challenge I mentioned: the rise of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence. To illustrate what cooperation on new technologies can look like, let me draw your attention to the Innovation Hub operated by the Bank for International Settlements. The Hub has innovation centres in various locations worldwide. One such innovation centre for all Eurosystem central banks is jointly located at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main and the Banque de France in Paris. The aim of the BIS Innovation Hub is to improve the functioning of the global financial system. To this end, key innovations in the financial sector are identified, analysed and also developed for central banks. In addition, the Innovation Hub coordinates a global network of central bank experts, pooling central banks' knowledge and efforts to keep pace with rapid technological developments. Finally, I would like to mention the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The global network of more than 140 central banks and supervisory authorities is committed to a more sustainable financial system. Its aim is to analyse the impact of climate change and nature loss and to strengthen the role of the financial system in financing the transition to a sustainable economy. The NGFS was established in December 2017; the Bundesbank has been serving as chair since 2024. Now you might ask, but what do you do if ""might is right"" seems to be the order of the day? If there is no willingness to cooperate? My answer: we must face up to the facts. International cooperation has become more arduous. Some countries may try to bypass or marginalise international institutions. However, this does not mean we should all simply abandon international cooperation. For those of us who still believe in a rules-based world, one truth stays the same as ever: together we are stronger. We should seek common solutions where this is possible, with whom this is possible. That is the recommendation my former colleague Mark Carney gave in a brilliant speech in Davos five days ago. 4 And I agree with him. 3 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me close with a brief summary. As you will no doubt have noticed, I am proud to be part of a community of central banks that is tackling major challenges together. Experience has shown that this can be very helpful. For the German economy, we at the Bundesbank see sizeable challenges. Germany's recession in 2023 and 2024 is indicator enough. Last year, GDP grew only slightly. And the Bundesbank expects Germany to embark on a slow return to recovery this year. Last March, I outlined economic policies which could help Germany to cope with its challenges. 5 Since then, we have seen first steps in the right direction, but there is still a lot to be done. Speaking in Davos last week, Chancellor Friedrich Merz vividly explained that progress has to be made in four areas simultaneously, and I quote: We must continue supporting Ukraine in its fight for a just peace. We must become capable of defending ourselves on our own in Europe. We want to reduce dependencies that currently make us vulnerable. And fourth, we want to ensure that our economy can tap into its full potential for innovation and growth. 6 One thing is clear: many of today's challenges cannot be tackled by an individual country on its own. Many of these major challenges are global in nature. We are best able to solve them together – by talking and negotiating with each other, in a spirit of cooperation and consensus-seeking, with everybody embracing respectful, rules-based interaction. I have a hunch that's what you ambassadors work to achieve most of the time, too. So I am now looking forward to our discussion and thank you very much for your attention. 1 Deutsche Bundesbank (2025), Forecast for Germany: Economy gradually returns to recovery path , Monthly Report , December 2025. 2 Deutsche Bundesbank (2025), Further development of the debt brake – a Bundesbank contribution to the reform debate , November 2025.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Thank you, Madame Ambassador, for the introduction and thank you also to the Delphi Economic Forum for the opportunity to speak today. My topic is the implications of deregulation for monetary policy, an appropriate one for this setting. Greece's recovery from the crisis that began in 2009 was only possible after the Greek people implemented substantial and painful reforms, including alleviating suffocating over-regulation in many sectors. In addition to the other reforms embraced by Greece, deregulation freed businesses to compete domestically and internationally, and promoted individuals' access to the economy. The range of reforms has included liberalizing product and service markets, easing licensing and administrative burdens, opening previously restricted professions, and increasing labor market flexibility. The government liberalized electricity and gas utilities; privatized airports, ports, and utilities; and reformed bankruptcy procedures and other business laws. While it is challenging to quantify how these deregulatory actions have affected the economy, there is little doubt that these reforms have supported a remarkable return to economic growth and higher living standards. Macroeconomic stability has returned to Greece. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, and investment and exports have rebounded. Product and labor market reforms helped restore competitiveness, reduce unit labor costs, and encourage firm entry. By easing the ability of supply to respond to prices, these reforms have improved the transmission of monetary policy. While monetary policy is set by the ECB, its transmission varies in part with how national governments manage their economies. Long-term Greek borrowing rates narrowed their spread to Germany's, below 1 percent, compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Greece has a come a long way, impressing the whole world with its recovery.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. My dear colleagues at the Bank of Korea, The year 2026 has dawned. I sincerely wish all of you and your families health and peace in the your daily lives. First of all, let me express my sincere gratitude to all of our staff who did their best in their respective roles despite difficult circumstances over the past year, as well as to the members of the Monetary Policy Board for their leadership in conducting monetary policy. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank your families, who have steadfastly supported you behind the scenes. Thanks to your collective dedication, the Bank of Korea was able to endure the past year successfully. Last year, our economy faced numerous challenges and upheavals, making it difficult to see even a short distance ahead. We went through a difficult phase in the first quarter, experiencing negative growth due to the fallout from the unexpected political shock. In April, the global trade environment also deteriorated sharply following the Trump administration's unprecedentedly aggressive tariff measures. Fortunately, as political risks eased following the presidential election in June, growth momentum partially recovered. Nevertheless, the trade conflict surrounding the Korea–United States investment agreement persisted until the APEC Leaders' Meeting at the end of October, which made it difficult to gauge the pace of economic recovery. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Korea was also required to make difficult policy judgments at every moment in conducting monetary policy. Immediately after the declaration of martial law, we focused on instilling confidence at home and abroad that the economic system was operating normally and independently from politics. Subsequently, as growth slowed amid stable inflation, the Bank cut the Base Rate twice during the first half of the year. The Bank also, continued to support vulnerable sectors through the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility. As we moved into the second half of the year, heightened instability in the housing market in the Seoul metropolitan area and increased exchange rate volatility intensified the tension between the two objectives of growth and financial stability. As a result, the Bank decided to keep the Base Rate unchanged. My dear colleagues, This year, the conditions surrounding our economy are also expected to remain challenging. While it may be desirable to deliver a message of hope at the start of a new year, I believe that today's occasion should go beyond a simple New Year's greeting. It should serve as a moment to soberly recognize the realities we face and to reaffirm our responsibilities and resolve as a central bank. Looking at the external conditions this year, a range of risk factors related to the global trade environment and the fiscal policies of major economies remain present. First of all, there is significant uncertainty regarding the global trade landscape and the monetary policies of major countries. On the trade front, risks concerning tariffs and trade policy could resurface depending on how judicial and political developments in the United States unfold. If tensions between the United States and China were to escalate amid discussions on ""global imbalances,"" a key agenda item at this year's G20 meetings, it would be difficult for Korea to remain unaffected. Uncertainty surrounding the investment agreement with the United States cannot yet be considered resolved. Although related risks have eased since the APEC Leaders' Meeting last October, further clarification is still needed with respect to specific investment targets and modalities. In addition, we are well aware of concerns that annual US-bound investment flows of up to USD 20 billion could exert depreciation pressure on the Korean won. However, this figure represents the maximum ceiling. As stipulated in the bilateral MOU, the actual scale of investment will be determined within a range that does not undermine foreign exchange market stability (Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources, 2025). In other words, this does not imply a mechanical annual outflow of USD 20 billion in investment funds to the United States, and the Bank of Korea, together with the government, will ensure that the actual decided-upon investment flow does not compromise foreign exchange market stability. This principle will be firmly upheld without exception. Moreover, there is also a high degree of uncertainty surrounding monetary policy in major economies. One key source of uncertainty relates to the future policy direction of the Federal Reserve and its implications for global financial markets, particularly after the scheduled end of Chair Powell's term in May. In addition, other major economies, including Japan, the euro area, and Australia, have begun policy rate hikes or may potentially shift their policy stances. Such divergences in monetary policy paths across countries could amplify market volatility. Attention should also be paid to the impact of fiscal soundness and government bond market conditions in major economies on domestic and global financial markets. Fiscal conditions have deteriorated markedly due to increased fiscal spending associated with population aging and a rising interest payment burden stemming from elevated government debt accumulated since the COVID-19 pandemic (Bank of Korea, 2025a; IMF, 2025a). Reflecting these developments, global long-term government bond yields have risen substantially. More recently, as the influence of non-bank financial institutions has expanded in repo markets collateralized by government bond, vigilance has increased regarding the risk that vulnerabilities could be amplified in the event of a shock. (Banerjee, R. et al., 2025). As market concerns about fiscal soundness increase and their impacts may differ across countries, we need to closely monitor spillovers to Korean government bond yields. At the same time, we should take the situations faced by other economies as a cautionary lesson and maintain vigilance against the expansion of fiscal and financial risks. Meanwhile, the possibility that expectations for the global AI industry could be revised also represents another key risk factor for financial markets (IMF, 2025b). Recently, amid a rapid rise in the stock prices of AI-related companies, concerns have intensified in the United States that price correction risks could spill over more broadly due to interconnected debt structures among AI firms. Given Korea's competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing, which underpins the AI industry ecosystem, Korea is likely to maintain a relatively high degree of resilience regardless of the outcome of global competition among AI firms. Nevertheless, as domestic investors' exposure to global AI companies has expanded significantly, it has become increasingly important to manage risks in preparation for the possibility of a sharp correction in the US stock market. My dear colleagues, Let me now turn to domestic conditions. First, consumer price inflation has recently risen to the low-to-mid 2% range, reflecting the effects of adverse weather conditions and the rising exchange rate. However, once these temporary factors ease, inflation this year is expected to record 2.1%, the same as last year, as demand pressures remain subdued. Such a trajectory would be more stable than those of major economies. That said, we need to remain mindful that inflationary pressures could intensify again if the elevated level of the exchange rate persists. In addition, there is concern that, as a result of cumulative high inflation since the pandemic, elevated living costs are placing a heavier burden on low-income households. To address these challenges, stabilizing inflation through monetary policy alone will not be sufficient. For items whose prices remain high by international standards, it will also be necessary to pursue structural reforms, including improvements in distribution structures and greater import openness (Im, W. et al., 2024). Turning to growth, the growth rate this year is projected at 1.8%, significantly higher than last year's 1.0%, and close to its potential level. However, this outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty on both the upside and the downside, depending on developments in the global trade environment, the semiconductor cycle, and the pace of the recovery in domestic demand (Bank of Korea, 2025b). Moreover, excluding the IT sector, which is expected to lead growth this year on the back of the global semiconductor upturn, the growth rate would be limited to 1.4%, and, amid widening disparities in the pace of recovery across sectors, a sizable gap is likely to open up between headline indicators and actual economic sentiment. Such a ""K-shaped recovery"" can hardly be regarded as sustainable or complete. As I noted in last year's New Year's speech, it is essential to continue our efforts toward structural reform, including diversifying the growth base by developing new industries, and to prevent a recurrence of growth and recovery patterns that are overly concentrated in specific sectors. Next, I would like to address exchange rate volatility, which has recently become a source of growing concern. At the end of last year, the Korean won–US dollar exchange rate rose to the upper 1,400 won range, and market vigilance remains high. Given that Korea is a net external creditor country with sound external fundamentals, it is not appropriate to view the current situation as comparable to past crisis episodes based solely on the recent level of the exchange rate. However, it is important to remain mindful that a rising exchange rate can add to inflationary pressures and weigh relatively heavily on domestic-oriented firms, thereby exacerbating the polarization discussed earlier. While it is difficult to pin down an appropriate level for the exchange rate, the recent level in the upper 1,400 won range appears to be substantially misaligned with Korea's economic fundamentals. The elevated exchange rate reflects, among other factors, growth and interest rate differentials between Korea and the United States, as well as the so-called ""Korea discount."" Addressing these issues will require, over the medium to long term, strengthening industrial competitiveness and expanding investment incentives through capital market reforms. Meanwhile, the relatively larger depreciation of the won since last October, compared with the US dollar, also reflects persistently rising residents' overseas securities investment, which has created supply-demand imbalances in the foreign exchange market and, in turn, exerted substantial short-term upward pressure on the exchange rate. In response, the foreign exchange authorities found it necessary to implement short-term measures late last year to stabilize the foreign exchange market. In particular, as we look back on the won's depreciation over the past three years, I strongly feel it is necessary to reassess the macroeconomic impact of the National Pension Service's (NPS) overseas investments, which are exerting increasingly greater influence on the foreign exchange market, alongside safeguarding the pension's long-term returns. The scale and timing of the NPS's overseas investments, as well as its foreign exchange hedging strategies, have become overly transparent to domestic and international markets. As a result, expectations of currency depreciation tilted overwhelmingly in one direction, increasing the risk of influencing the investment decisions of other economic agents at home and abroad. In addition, while the investment decisions of economic agents are based on rational judgment under given conditions, the time has come to take a comprehensive look at the broader implications of persistently expanding residents' overseas investment for economic growth and the development of the domestic capital market. If this situation persists without serious reflection and without a coordinated, government-wide framework to address its macroeconomic implications, we could find ourselves in a recurring dilemma. In other words, even amid heightened tensions in the foreign exchange market, the NPS would continue to purchase US dollars according to its preset plans, while the foreign exchange authorities would be compelled to sell dollars. In this process, even if the depreciation of the won boosts the National Pension Service's won-denominated book returns, this does not necessarily represent a long-term increase in the retirement assets of the Korean people. Against this backdrop, it is a meaningful step forward that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has recently launched a task force to allow flexible strategic hedging responses, and that the relevant government ministries, the NPS, and the Bank of Korea have agreed to cooperate and discuss the establishment of a ""New Framework"" for the NPS's overseas investment. We look forward to appropriate improvement measures being put into place in the near future. My dear colleagues of the Bank of Korea, Considering all of these risk factors, just like in the past year, we are likely to be called upon to make difficult policy judgments at every turn this year. This is because there are both upside and downside risks to the growth path, and inflation dynamics could vary depending on exchange rate movements. In addition, from the perspective of financial stability, there is a need to continue to closely monitor developments in housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area. As uncertainty in the policy environment increases and trade-offs among policy variables intensify, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy in a more calibrated manner, carefully assessing a wide range of economic indicators. In this process, communication with markets will become even more important. There may be moments when we must face misunderstandings and criticism, but we will make the best possible decisions guided by a strong sense of responsibility. As we actively communicate the direction of monetary policy amid high uncertainty, when this communication diverges from market expectations, interest rate volatility may increase in the short term and criticism from economic agents who incur losses in the process may intensify. However, such volatility is an unavoidable part of narrowing gaps in perceptions between the market and policymakers regarding economic conditions. Rather than seeking to avoid these risks by lagging behind market expectations, it is an essential responsibility of a central bank to explain the direction of monetary policy in a timely manner as policy conditions change. With this in mind, the Bank of Korea will further refine our policy communication to enhance credibility, reviewing the operational approach to Monetary Policy Board members' ""Base Rate Prospects with Conditions for the Next Three Months"" (Bank of Korea, 2025c). The Bank of Korea will also continue efforts to strengthen monetary policy tools in addition to the Base Rate. Discussions are ongoing to reorganize the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility in a manner that reduces its quasi-fiscal policy characteristics, while reinforcing its role as a complementary tool to interest rate policy. Specifically, the facility will place greater emphasis on providing targeted and temporary support to vulnerable sectors, such as regional small and medium-sized enterprises that are relatively more affected by interest rate policy. Also, the Bank will expand the role of lending facilities as a liquidity backstop. Starting this year, the Bank will begin operating the ""Eligible Collateral System for the Utilization of Banks' Loans."" In parallel, from a financial stability perspective, we are also consulting with relevant authorities on amendments to the Bank of Korea Act to allow the coverage of this system to be extended to non-bank deposit-taking institutions (Bank of Korea, 2025d). This will mark an important turning point in further enhancing the central bank's crisis response capacity. Alongside the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank of Korea cannot afford to neglect our role as a think tank on the Korean economy. Over the past three years, in the course of presenting policy alternatives through the ""Structural Reform Research Series,"" our work has at times sparked public debate, and there have also been voices arguing that the Bank should focus on its primary role. However, the main focus of this series has been on how to raise Korea's potential growth rate, which has been on a sustained downward trend, an issue that is closely intertwined with monetary policy as well. According to a recent internal survey, 53% of our staff view the Bank's discussions on structural reform positively, while negative views account for only 9%. It is encouraging to see that an internal consensus has formed on the need for research into structural reforms. Going forward, it will be important not merely to raise issues, but to demonstrate our expertise and competitiveness by presenting practical and realistic solutions to structural challenges. Good examples include the report on won-denominated stablecoins that received an award from the press corps late last year, as well as studies on the introduction of autonomous taxi services, improvements to the life-sustaining treatment decision framework, and sustainable employment for older workers (Bank of Korea, 2025e; Noh, J. et al., 2025; Kim, T. et al., 2025; Oh, S. et al., 2025). Through such high-quality research, the Bank must continue to serve as a compass that helps guide the direction of our economy. Over the past year, the Bank of Korea has devoted considerable efforts not only to addressing the structural challenges facing the Korean economy, but also to advancing internal structural reform initiatives. In particular, advances in digital technology and AI innovation have presented new challenges. To respond proactively to these structural changes in digital finance, the Bank completed the first phase of pilot testing under ""Project Hangang"" last year and plans to carry out the second phase this year (Bank of Korea, 2025f). Through these efforts, the Bank will actively support the government's project to improve national funds management using blockchain technology (Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2025), accumulate practical experience in the use of programmable money, and further strengthen the foundation for the commercialization of digital currency systems and deposit tokens. The Bank believes that the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins is necessary to prepare for a digital currency system, and has already presented possible introduction frameworks that promote innovation while minimizing potential risks. Looking ahead, the Bank will actively participate in legislative discussions with the National Assembly and the government. Regarding AI technological innovation, we plan to unveil the ""Bank of Korea AI Language Model"" by the end of this month, following its development over the past year in collaboration with a major domestic company. We will also proceed without delay with the network integration project to enable more effective use of this model and complete it by March. I hope that all of you will become agents of change by integrating AI into your work, driving innovation in our working methods and evolving into professionals equipped with the capabilities required in a new era. At the same time, I expect that the introduction of this language model based on domestic sovereign AI will serve as an exemplary case of public-private cooperation and contribute to the development of Korea's AI ecosystem. We will continue close cooperation with the private sector so that our sovereign AI can compete on equal footing with overseas AI technologies and maintain its competitiveness. My dear colleagues, As I bring my remarks on policy conduct to a close, I would like to conclude this New Year's Speech by expressing my deep gratitude for the dedication and hard work of all of you. First, I sincerely thank everyone who took part in the voluntary donation campaign at the end of last year, achieving a high participation rate of 79.9%. The fact that more than 2,400 employees came together with a shared sense of purpose is a meaningful testament to our unity and strong sense of community, and it is a source of great pride. I was deeply moved by the warmth and generosity you showed, and I hope that a culture of sharing will take even firmer root within our organization in the years ahead. Moreover, thanks to the organizational culture improvement efforts pursued over the past three years, our organization's dynamism has clearly been strengthened and our staff's capabilities have notably improved. Cooperation and information sharing across departments have expanded, and a culture of open and free exchange of ideas is taking root at a rapid pace. Our research processes are also shifting from a top-down approach to a bottom-up approach. These changes are being recognized externally as well, which is highly encouraging. Media reports citing the Bank's data and publications increased by about 11% year-on-year, while the number of subscribers to our official YouTube channel has surpassed 110,000. 1 Exchanges between our regional branches and local governments have also become more active, including through initiatives such as the ""BOK Regional Economy Symposium."" In addition, I can feel our communication expanding further as staff at regional branches contribute to local media and appear on broadcasts, allowing their capabilities to shine in many different arenas. In this regard, I would like to express my deep gratitude to all of our staff who have done their utmost in their respective roles. I also wish to extend my sincere appreciation to those who have worked diligently behind the scenes in areas such as public service response, currency processing, facilities and security management, administrative support, and environmental maintenance. As I noted at the outset, a range of challenges and tasks await us in the new year. The road ahead will by no means be easy. However, as the saying goes, ""where there is a will, there is a way,"" and if we unite around a common purpose, we will be fully capable of overcoming them. The work we do is complex and at times we may face misunderstandings and criticism. Nevertheless, if we keep firmly in mind our principles and mission as central bankers, and devote ourselves with a clear focus on the long-term stability of the Korean economy, our efforts will surely be recognized. If we are not afraid of making mistakes, but instead treat trial and error as opportunities for learning and continue to strive, the capabilities and culture of our organization will grow ever more mature. Let us open the new year with vigor, drawing on the dynamic energy symbolized by the Year of the Red Horse. Once again, I sincerely wish good health and happiness to all of you and your families. Thank you. I would like to thank Choongwon Park, In Hyup Choi, and Byeongrok Lee for their help in preparing this speech. * This is an unofficial English translation of the original speech released on 2 January 2026. 1 The number of articles mentioning the Bank of Korea, based on data from the Korea Press Foundation's BIG KINDS database, increased from approximately 36,000 in 2024 to about 41,000 in 2025.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good morning and Namaskar. It is my privilege to address the third annual global conference of the College of Supervisors. Advancement in technology is impacting all spheres of human activity – personal, business and public. Financial system is no exception. Technology has revolutionised banking over the years. Yet, today's landscape is distinct - the pace and scale of change are unprecedented. Technology has introduced new products, partners, and processes. Digitalisation is widening access, enhancing efficiency, improving convenience, and enabling far more tailored financial services. At the same time, it is reshaping the nature and scale of risks. It is also accelerating the transmission of disruptions and risks underscoring the need for agility in regulatory and supervisory response. This makes the theme of the conference very apt. I want to focus on five key messages today in my address: i) Systemic resilience as a collaborative effort ii) Supervisory action and enforcement as corrective measures iii) Effective use of data iv) Customer-centricity v) Capacity building I. Systemic resilience as a collaborative effort First, I want to emphasise that we in RBI view our regulatory and supervisory roles vis-a-vis the regulated entities as collaborative and not adversarial. We measure our success as a regulator not only in terms of stability but also the dynamism and vibrancy in the financial sector. Similarly, for the regulated entities to succeed in the long term, stability is essential. Essentially, the objectives and purposes of the regulator and the regulated are the same viz. to ensure the long term growth, advancement, stability, integrity, and credibility of the financial system. The regulators and the regulated are in the same team and not opposite camps. We are partners in the nation's development. Therefore, we have to work together to strike the right balance between growth and systemic stability on the one hand and between responsible innovation and consumer protection on the other hand. I may mention that even the function of regulation and supervision is a collaborative effort. Almost every regulation is finalised through a consultative approach. Moreover, regulated entities also self-regulate through their own internal rules, controls, checks and procedures. Regulated entities have their own, if one can say so, in a broad sense, supervision - through their boards, senior management and assurance teams – both internal and external. Thus, while the statutory mandate to regulate and supervise lies with RBI, the obligation to uphold systemic resilience, to better serve the customers and facilitate the growth of the economy are shared responsibilities. It is a collaborative work with a collective aspiration. Let us all remember that regulation works best when banks and other regulated entities view supervisors not as fault-finding inspectors, but as partners in resilience. For a country like India, where banks play a critical role in financial intermediation and inclusive growth, this collaborative approach is not just desirable-it is essential. II. Supervisory action and enforcement as corrective measures I now come to my second point. Supervisory action and enforcement are often viewed as the most visible aspect of regulation and supervision. It is therefore important to clarify that such actions by the Reserve Bank must be seen as part of a continuum of supervisory tools, not as a standalone response. This continuum begins with training and capacity building and moves through dialogue and guidance, off-site and on-site supervision. Enforcement, restrictions and penalties are measures of last resort. Our endeavour is to have a robust financial ecosystem where supervision encourages self-correction and enforcement acts only as backstop. Moreover, the purpose of enforcement actions undertaken by the Reserve Bank is generally not punitive. The intent is largely to correct. They serve two purposes - (i) signal to those against whom such measures have been initiated; and (ii) make others aware of our acceptable standards of conduct and expectations. III. Effective use of data My third point is related to reports that the regulated entities submit and the data that we collect for various purposes including supervision and regulation. We have undertaken several initiatives in the past to streamline the reporting mechanisms and improve the quality of data. We collect large amounts of data through platforms like CIMS and DAKSH. While some amount of burden is placed on all of you in this process, our supervisory capabilities have been strengthened because of your support. I am happy to note that the quality of data has improved recently, following introduction of the Supervisory Data Quality Index (SDQI) last year. I am confident that we will continue to collaborate for improving the system while reducing the burden placed on regulated entities. While we have made good use of this data, there is scope for more effective use of this data. For example, Department of Supervision can build stronger analytics and supervisory dash boards for enhanced off-site surveillance, to support more continuous monitoring and early risk detection. Our endeavour should be to make supervision more off-site than on-site and as near real-time and not periodic. Increasingly, this will also mean using SupTech and AI-enabled tools more deeply, while retaining judgment and accountability, firmly with supervisors. Similarly, Department of Regulation can use this for evidence based regulation making. It should be our endeavour to make better and effective use of data. IV. Customer-centricity I will now turn my attention to the use of technology for the benefit of customers. For all of us, protecting customers' interest is not just a priority – it has to become the cornerstone of a sustainable and resilient financial system. Digital channels facilitate our efforts by improving inclusion and convenience. But, without guardrails, they can also facilitate opaque pricing, weak disclosures and inappropriate recovery practices. Our aim should be to ensure that digitalisation and innovations are aligned with fair outcomes for consumers. A key element of this endeavour should be to protect customers from the menace of rising digital frauds, which has engaged national attention. While banks and other regulated entities individually should continue to improve their tools, techniques and processes in preventing and tackling digital frauds, this is an area where we need to collaborate with each other to build analytics and tools to detect mule accounts and suspicious transactions timely and pre-emptively. V. Capacity building Before I conclude, let me acknowledge that there are huge expectations from all of us in financial system. To deliver on these expectations, and on our broader mandate, we must improve our effectiveness. This can only be achieved when we have the right mix of skills not only within the Reserve Bank across regulatory and supervisory domains but also within the financial institutions. Moreover, a strong financial system needs supervisors, regulators as also the regulated entities to provide feedback and learn continuously from each other. Regulated entities need to better understand regulatory expectations and requirements, particularly in the areas where models, partners, data, and digital delivery create new forms of risk. They need to imbibe the essence of regulation and follow the spirit of it and not merely follow a tick-box based compliance culture. Our endeavour, rather, should be to develop common understanding which can reduce frictions and improve outcomes. Supervisors and regulators need to provide timely inputs and clarifications. Supervision should not only enforce existing regulations, but also help refine them by flagging regulatory gaps and inconsistencies observed during supervisory engagements. The amendments to the co-lending directions and lending against gold & silver jewellery last year were few recent examples where feedback from all the stakeholders helped us refine regulations. This feedback process is not just limited to supervisory engagement but also includes regulatory or supervisory reporting of data. We need to intensify our engagement and capacity building efforts. This is where institutions like the College of Supervisors (CoS) can contribute immensely. CoS is not only a training institution. It is a platform for building a shared language of oversight, learning from case studies and practical scenarios. It provides a forum for skill upgradation and bridging the information gap between the Reserve Bank and our regulated entities. I urge all of you to collaborate and utilise the facilities offered by the CoS, more often. Conclusion As I conclude my address, I want to emphasise that the fundamental architecture of regulation and supervision remains the same even in the digital era. They still follow the guiding principle of risk sensitivity. Regulated entities still have their stakeholders' interest topmost in mind. Nonetheless, digitalisation has altered the landscape in many ways. I will leave you with a few key points to ponder and deliberate upon: First, regulation and supervision must remain risk-based, proportionate, and technology-neutral; Second, technology must embed compliance, not bypass it; and Third, accountability must remain human, and automation should not dilute accountability -it should sharpen it. I am confident that your deliberations during the day will yield actionable insights on how regulation and supervision should adapt, and how we can forge stronger pathways for cooperation with our key stakeholders and peers. I thank the CoS team for organising this conference and giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts. I wish you a very productive and successful conference. Thank you. Namaskar.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. There are moments that are difficult to explain with figures, analyses, or institutional formulas. Moments in which what is heard is not a position, but an experience. Increasingly often, young, highly educated Bulgarians speak about Bulgaria's European path with an emotion that cannot be learned or simulated – with a confidence that comes not from declarations, but from belonging. A few weeks ago, I attended such a conversation. A Bulgarian who grew up in the Netherlands and today holds a responsible position in a European institution said, quite simply: ""From a young age, I tried to convince my classmates and friends that Bulgaria is part of Europe. They did not understand me. Today, everyone understands."" There was no pose in those words. There was calmness and clarity. Today, the words ""Welcome, Bulgaria"" can be heard and seen in Frankfurt, Brussels, Luxembourg, and in many other places across Europe. Our response to our friends there is brief and clear: ""Thank you, friends. We are home."" This is not protocol. This is a feeling. In this sense, the euro is not merely an economic decision. It is not just a currency. It is a sign of belonging – that your place is not on the periphery, but within a space of shared rules, trust, and responsibility. A sign that the effort you have made has been recognised and accepted. The Bulgarian lev has always been more than money. Its name comes from the lion – a symbol that has accompanied Bulgarian statehood for centuries. The lev remains part of our history and of the memory of generations of Bulgarians. No one is taking it away. It simply takes its place in the story of our country – alongside the marks, francs, and liras of other European nations. The euro does not interrupt this story. It continues it. The Bulgarian letters, the images of the Madara Horseman, Saint Ivan of Rila, and Paisius of Hilendar on European currency state clearly: we are not abandoning who we are. We are affirming who we are. In recent days, this choice was also acknowledged by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew – with that calm authority that does not judge, but recognises the meaning of symbols. A moment that reflects Bulgaria's confident presence in Europe, spiritual maturity, and respect for its own history. Not as a renunciation of identity, but as its confident presence within a broader community. This moment does not call for exaltation. It calls for clarity. And for the calm confidence that belonging, memory, and the future can move forward together. GOD SAVE BULGARIA This is what is written on the newest European coins. And that says enough. Because Bulgaria is Europe. And Europe is Bulgaria. Related information More speeches from ""Bulgarian National Bank"" Country page: Bulgaria",html,2026-02-04 03:14:59,False,,,,

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. I would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today. 1 Throughout my now seven years as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I have found that direct outreach with bankers has been the most effective way to learn about and understand your perspectives on improving the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and on local banking and economic conditions. It has now been seven months since I was appointed by President Trump as Vice Chair for Supervision. It is an incredible honor and a profound responsibility to serve in this role. Since I first joined the Board in November 2018, we have faced significant challenges in the banking system and in the economy. Serving on the Board during this time has provided a unique perspective about the banking system and specifically this role, including how to effectively carry out its important responsibilities and promote the safety and soundness of the banking system. Over the past seven months, I have implemented a comprehensive approach to pragmatic supervision and regulation. As we work to preserve safety and soundness, we must ensure the U.S. banking system remains efficient, innovative, and accessible. This is especially important for the small and community banks that serve Americans across the country, including my hometown in Kansas. Drawing from my own experience as a community banker and as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner, I have prioritized tailoring our approach to reflect the unique profiles of banks, refocusing our supervision on early detection and remediation of material financial risks and enhancing transparency in our processes. You know these risks well-they are the core risks that truly threaten the viability and safety and soundness of institutions and the stability of the broader financial system. The past seven years as a Governor have also profoundly shaped my approach to this role. They provided an invaluable, front-row perspective on the evolution of supervisory policy, the internal deliberations of the Board, and the real-world impact of our decisions on banks of all sizes. I observed first-hand how certain regulatory and supervisory practices-which may be well-intended-can drift to focus on subjective, politicized, or tangential issues that divert our attention from the risks that materially impact safety and soundness and financial stability. Leveraging these experiences allows me to explain not just what we are changing, but why -rooting reforms in observed outcomes rather than abstract theory. This approach bridges Washington policymaking with Main Street banking, ensuring that our supervisory and regulatory framework reflects lessons learned and prioritizes what truly matters for safety and soundness and financial stability. Progress in Supervisory and Regulatory Modernization Since June of last year, we have significantly advanced on the agenda I laid out in my Georgetown University speech. 2 While we have made a great deal of progress in just a few months' time, today, I would like to focus on a few of these priorities. Beginning with properly targeted supervision. Supervision is a powerful instrument for promoting safety and soundness. It enables examiners to rigorously assess institutions and detect any material weaknesses requiring remediation. Every institution is distinct-with respect to its products and services, geographic presence, market position, and the specific risks it poses. Supervision is one of our most valuable diagnostic tools. It requires a balanced approach, tough decisions, and reasoned judgement. What is the scope of the examination? Which risks should be prioritized? Are there new or emerging risks that require additional review? To be effective in promoting safety and soundness and U.S. financial stability, supervision must focus on the most important risks-which are the core and material financial risks. In late October 2025, for the first time, the Federal Reserve published supervisory operating principles designed to enhance supervisory transparency and accountability and sharpen our examination processes. 3 These principles direct supervisory staff to identify and require early remediation of material financial risks. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) exposed critical flaws in our prior supervisory approach, which became an ever-expanding scope of unfocused activities that led examiners and the bank to overlook or downplay severe interest-rate and liquidity risks that triggered the bank's collapse and eroded broader public confidence. As I have said a number of times in the past, significant lessons remain from the SVB episode, and we are committed to identifying and rigorously addressing them. Turning back to the operating principles, since their introduction, we have made significant progress in their implementation, including through question and answer sessions with leaders and staff throughout the Federal Reserve System, both at the Board and the Reserve Banks; providing illustrative examples to demonstrate how they should be applied in different circumstances, which we will add to over time; hosting conversations and answering questions from Supervision leaders and staff; and soliciting feedback from regulated firms. If we discover areas that should have been included but were not covered in the initial set of principles, or if we find that there is confusion or misunderstanding about how they should be applied we will refine our approach. We have also made an important change to the LFI ratings framework that applies to the largest banks. The changes ensure that the ""well-managed"" status of a firm is reflective of its overall ratings and risk, rather than disproportionately weighting a single supervisory component to drive this overall assessment of the firm. While this is an important step, we recognize that there is more work to be done on bank ratings frameworks, which I will discuss shortly. We have also eliminated the use of ""reputational risk"" in the supervisory process. In the past, this imprecise supervisory tool has been misused to prohibit politically disfavored activities. And in furtherance of our focus on core and material financial risks, we have rescinded the climate guidance that diverted supervisory resources away from risks that are material to the safety and soundness of banks. This guidance forced institutions to devote excessive resources to collecting climate-related data from customers and prospective customers, and to forecast business risks beyond any reasonable or reliable forecasting window, potentially decades into the future-all to address risks that banks are already required to manage. In short, these climate principles did little to further our statutory objectives to protect safety and soundness and financial stability. Banking inherently involves risk. The regulatory framework aims not to eliminate risk, but to ensure the safe and sound management of risk. With proper prioritization, regulators and examiners can foster robust risk management while enabling banks to innovate, grow, and serve their customers, communities, and the broader U.S. economy. Since the mortgage crisis more than 15 years ago, bank regulation has been implemented under an overly granular ""more-is-better"" approach that has driven significant banking activity out of the regulated system and into less-supervised corners of the financial landscape. This framework is long overdue for a comprehensive review. An unfocused, process-heavy approach to regulation and supervision leaves banks less able to support economic activity, displaces activity into unregulated sectors, and ultimately makes the overall financial system less safe and stable. In recent months, we have introduced meaningful improvements, including publishing several proposals for public comment, and finalizing several critical reforms. We have proposed re-calibrating the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) to the statutory minimum to provide greater flexibility to eligible community banks. This would change the required level of capital for community banks electing the CBLR from 9 percent to 8 percent, a level that is still nearly double the required Tier 1 leverage ratio and preserves a strong capital foundation for these firms. The CBLR allows a community bank to choose to meet a single leverage capital requirement instead of the risk-based measures designed for larger banks. In addition to meeting the statutory capital requirement, it enables more community banks to take advantage of the relief that Congress intended. We look forward to receiving comments and ultimately finalizing the proposed revisions. We have also modified the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), returning it to its traditional role as a leverage-based backstop to risk-based capital requirements. In doing so, we are making real progress to enhance the stability of the U.S. Treasury market by enhancing intermediation capacity for large bank-affiliated broker-dealers. In addition, we are in the process of revising and enhancing the stress testing program to reduce year-over-year volatility, improve the reliability and accuracy of the models, and increase transparency. And in the coming days and weeks, the Board will announce additional regulatory changes to improve the fairness, transparency, and prioritization of the supervisory process. The Path Forward: Bank Regulatory and Supervisory Reforms While I hope that you are already seeing the benefits of these initial modernization efforts, there are a number of additional initiatives underway that will materially improve the bank regulatory framework for all sizes of banks-especially for community banks. Improving Supervision – Memorializing Changes in Regulation Staff will soon conclude several regulatory proposals that will guide our supervisory work. The first proposal would define what constitutes ""unsafe and unsound"" practices for supervision and enforcement activities. The second removes ""reputation risk"" from the supervisory process. These proposals will largely align with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposals, and are intended to demonstrate the Federal Reserve's commitment to transparency, fairness, and efficiency, which are the core principles I have supported for many years. Updating and Indexing Asset Thresholds Bank supervision and regulation applies based on the categorization of banks into ""portfolios,"" which are based on a combination of fixed statutory and regulatory thresholds. Many of these portfolios rely on only a single, fixed asset level, like the definition of a community bank at $10 billion or a large bank at $100 billion. This type of definition relies only on the bank's asset size regardless of its activities, business model, or risk profile. Among many other shortcomings, this approach does not account for economic growth and inflation over time. As a result, firms with stable growth, consistent business models, and no change in risk profile end up crossing asset thresholds and becoming subject to increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. While asset thresholds for portfolios play a significant role in the supervisory process, there are a wide range of thresholds that impact banks across the regulatory and statutory frameworks. Looking ahead, we will reconsider these regulatory thresholds and will work to support Congress in updating thresholds that have become outdated and too low relative to the broader economy. A simple solution would be to adjust thresholds by nominal GDP, which includes both economic growth and inflation. Doing so will result in a more robust and resilient system over time, proactively integrating indexed changes into the framework. It may also be worth considering whether single-metric thresholds, like those based purely on asset size, are the most effective way to align statutory, regulatory, and supervisory requirements with the underlying risk of the activity, or whether a more nuanced approach may be appropriate. For example, a more nuanced approach could consider things like business model and risk profile as inputs. I look forward to working with Congress and my regulatory colleagues to address these and other opportunities to update the regulatory framework. I also support taking a comprehensive approach to indexing statutory requirements broadly across all financial agency authorities, including for requirements that I did not directly reference in my remarks today. Supervisory Portfolios In several speeches over the past few years, I have outlined considerations for a more effective approach to supervising community banks. 4 This would require better aligning our supervisory approach to the complexity and risk profile of smaller institutions. Community banks should be subject to strict supervisory oversight, but it must be commensurate with their smaller size, simpler business activities, and the modest risks they pose to U.S. financial stability. This could be accomplished by separating the community bank oversight program from those designed for larger and regional banks, focusing examiner attention on small bank risks and activities. This would also eliminate the temptation to ""push down"" standards and expectations to community banks, that were designed for larger and more complex institutions. Material Financial Risk To avoid confusion, it may also be helpful to clarify what is meant by identifying material financial risks in the supervisory process. It does not mean focusing primarily on checking boxes in reviewing processes, procedures, and documentation, regardless of the assessment of risk. It also does not mean ignoring other aspects of the established supervisory program. As the supervisory operating principles note, focusing on material financial risks requires examiners to use reasoned judgment to prioritize through every stage of an examination. This begins with targeting in the pre-examination letter, the examination's scope of work, and differentiating between findings that meet the threshold of a matter requiring attention, and those that can be addressed through less formal means. The operating principles specifically reference supervisory observations for those matters that do not rise to the level of a violation but may be included in an examination report. Reducing Overlap in Examinations In conducting holding company supervision, the Federal Reserve is required by statute to rely ""to the fullest extent possible"" on examinations performed by a subsidiary bank's primary state or federal supervisors. In practice, complying with this requirement imposes significant limits on the Fed's supervisory activities. This applies to national banks regulated by the OCC and state non-member banks regulated by the FDIC and a state banking regulator. 5 The requirement is designed to avoid redundant and burdensome examination processes. However, to be effective, the Fed must have confidence in the supervisory processes and outcomes of these OCC, FDIC, and state banking agency exams, which requires access to and a thorough review of examination reports and activities. Where it is not possible to rely on or we do not have access to an exam or supporting documentation of supervisory activity, we may need to conduct our own review. Reports of Examination and Supervisory Ratings Each bank examination concludes with a report of examination. This report documents exam findings including any supervisory observations or criticisms, and matters requiring attention (MRAs) or matters requiring immediate attention (MRIAs), if any are found during the exam. The report also includes the bank's supervisory ratings according to the CAMELS rating system. 6 Exam findings and the inclusion of specific matters in the report can have serious consequences for the bank. In addition to directing how banks prioritize their efforts to remediate identified issues, the bank's CAMELS rating can influence whether the bank qualifies to receive favorable treatment of banking applications, affect the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, affect the cost of liquidity funding, and serve as an indication of bank management performance for its board of directors. The supervisory operating principles emphasize that examination findings and reports must focus on material financial risk. We are currently implementing several initiatives to reflect this approach including: revisiting the standard for issuing MRAs and MRIAs; ensuring that CAMELS ratings reflect a bank's risk profile and financial condition, including that the ""M"" for management is assessed on measurable factors; and reviving the use of non-binding supervisory ""observations,"" which identify matters of note that do not rise to the level of an MRA or MRIA. Although supervisory observations are not ""binding"" on the firm, in the sense that they do not require formal remediation, these informal communications are valuable for early identification of issues that may grow to become potential concerns. They also encourage constructive communication and feedback between examiners and bank management. Reporting and Applications Our work to modernize the frameworks also includes reporting and applications, especially for community banks. The obligation to provide data or other information, including through quarterly bank ""call reports"" creates a disproportionate burden on community banks. Often, regulators and supervisors do not review the information and data that is submitted. This presents an opportunity to revisit these data collections in a rigorous review that would ensure that each collection remains relevant and necessary for supervisory purposes, including whether there are lower-cost and less burdensome alternatives available. This certainly is a departure from recent regulatory approaches, in which more is always better, but collecting less information can help us to ensure we are focused on collecting the right and most valuable information. Revisiting our long-standing processes will help us to understand whether we have struck the right balance. Refining our approach to data collection can make a meaningful difference in reducing burden while also maintaining robust oversight and high standards. Like all banks, community banks often require regulatory approval to engage in some business activities and mergers, or to engage in new activities. The process of applying for regulatory approval has become uncertain, cumbersome, disruptive, and slow. In some cases, application forms may not require a bank to submit the necessary information needed to evaluate an application. The application process may also include standards that make little sense when applied to community banks, like using restrictive screens for evaluating the competitive effects of mergers in rural and underserved communities. In addition, the process often lacks specific action timelines necessary for business planning purposes. Mergers and acquisitions involve coordinating a number of time-dependent processes, including transaction closing and staffing related planning, and the process of scheduling technology integrations with specialized vendors. Missing deadlines can be costly for the institutions involved, and we are currently working to improve this process by addressing these and other challenges, especially for community banks. Transparency Finally, I would like to discuss transparency, which I see as a critical element of the regulatory and supervisory processes. Transparency in supervisory expectations is just as important as transparency in regulatory requirements, and yet it often receives the least scrutiny and attention. In part, the lack of transparency for supervision results from information security rules and how they apply to communication between banks and examiners. These have been protected from public scrutiny under the broad categorization of ""confidential supervisory information"" (CSI). Labeling information as CSI results in significant restrictions on its disclosure-banks and bank employees are subject to criminal penalties if they disclose CSI without regulatory approval even if doing so would serve beneficial purposes for bank safety and soundness. When banks share the latest information about fraud prevention among themselves-if some of the data is currently classified as CSI-the disclosure can be prohibited, even if sharing it could make all banks more resilient to emerging fraud risks. Likewise, bank regulators dedicate a great deal of time and effort to reviewing bank cyber risk profiles and controls, and yet opportunities for collaboration and sharing can be limited by the fear that sharing CSI could result in criminal penalties. These examples demonstrate how expansive the definition of CSI has become. The vague and over-broad definition and interpretation of CSI effectively prohibit constructive speech and information sharing. In addition to limiting valuable uses of information sharing, the limits can also serve to shield abusive supervisory behaviors. To address these weaknesses, we are reviewing approaches to better define or create circumstances in which CSI can be shared, including through creating limited use cases exempt from the definition of CSI. In another initiative to increase transparency, in December, we finally published a copy of the LISCC Operating Manual, which is one of the manuals used by Board and Reserve Bank staff to supervise the largest and most complex banks. 7 We plan to release the remaining LISCC administrative manuals in the coming weeks and months. The public release of these manuals is just the beginning of our efforts to increase the transparency of our administrative processes. We are working to identify other manuals and guidance to further enhance transparency and provide public accountability for our supervisory processes. Even though these documents are internally focused, they can give banks and the broader public insight into supervisory operations and expectations. Closing Thoughts As we continue our work to modernize the bank regulatory framework and our supervisory approach, I look forward to engaging with our stakeholders for feedback. Informal conversations, round table discussions and attending conferences like this one are helpful to achieve this goal. It also allows us to better understand the real-world consequences of our work. Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss our work with you today. 1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 Michelle W.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear and honored guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of the Banque de France, our warmest wishes to you and your loved ones. This year, France is taking on the G7 Presidency, with a number of priorities – addressing global imbalances but also delivering practical progress on six financial stability items: cross-border payments, NBFI, cybersecurity, AI, quantum technology and climate-related risks. It is therefore my pleasure to introduce today's stimulating sessions dedicated to the challenges of digital innovation and the consequences for the International Monetary System (IMS). Let me first outline two major disruptions, a fast-moving technological one and a slow-moving geopolitical one – to quote Governor Panetta's recent speech – (1), before sharing with you a triangle of three objectives, three ""S's"" that should guide us in the transition to a new global landscape for payments (2). 1. Two major disruptions are affecting the international monetary landscape 1.1. A technological disruption The first disruption is technological: financial innovations have the potential to reshape the IMS. Among them, tokenisation is accelerating end-to-end transaction execution and reducing costs, notably through ""smart contracts"". It can revolutionise cross-border payments and possibly domestic payments. Tokenisation could affect the IMS through two opposite forces. On the one hand, it may reinforce the US dollar's centrality with a potentially rapid development of stablecoins in USD held outside the United States. Supported by a resilient US financial sector and actively promoted by the US administration, stablecoins – 99% USD-backed so far – could reach a market capitalisation of between USD 500 billion and USD 2 trillion by 2028 according to some projections.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear journalists, experts, and media executives, Dear ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your participation in this end-of-year meeting, which has by now become a well-established forum for dialogue between the Bank of Albania and media representatives. This meeting serves as both a platform to reflect on the economic and financial developments of the year drawing to a close and to acknowledge the crucial role of the media in informing the public, fostering confidence, and strengthening institutional transparency. Against the backdrop of an increasingly complex environment, in which monetary and financial decision-making is shaped by a wide range of domestic and external factors, clear, accurate and professional communication is of paramount importance. In this context, our collaboration has been instrumental in ensuring that the public receives reliable, clear, and balanced information on economic developments in Albania. The year 2025 has been of particular significance for the Bank of Albania, not only in light of the economic challenges addressed and achievements attained, but also owing to its historical importance. This year marked the centenary of the central bank's founding-a milestone that invites both a proud reflection on the past and a responsible consideration of the challenges ahead. From the economic and financial perspective, the Albanian economy has continued to exhibit a positive performance. Economic activity expanded at a steady pace, the labour market remained robust, and inflation stayed at low levels. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Albania's monetary policy stance has been prudent and stability-oriented, seeking to strike an appropriate balance between maintaining price stability and supporting sustainable economic growth. The Albanian banking system has continued to demonstrate resilience and a high degree of financial soundness. Banks remain well capitalised, liquidity is ample and the quality of credit portfolio has continued to improve. This stability-far from being coincidental-is the result of a robust regulatory framework, effective supervision and ongoing close cooperation between the Bank of Albania and the banking sector. Throughout this journey, the media has played an indispensable role. Through analysis, informed debate, and professional interpretation, you have contributed significantly to explaining our policy decisions, clarifying economic concepts, and shaping public expectations. This role is particularly important at a time when information circulates rapidly, and the risks associated with misinformation are tangible. The celebration of the Bank of Albania's centenary has served as an important platform for reflection and public communication. Through a range of institutional, academic, and cultural events, we have sought to highlight the close link between the central bank's history and that of the Albanian state, as well as its enduring role in promoting monetary stability and fostering public confidence in institutions. This anniversary serves as a reminder that independence, professionalism, and transparency are core values that must be safeguarded and strengthened on an ongoing basis. Within this context, public communication remains one of our key strategic priorities. The Bank of Albania recognises that its decisions have a direct impact on citizens, businesses, and financial markets. Accordingly, we have invested-and will continue to invest-in enhancing the effectiveness of our communication, with a view to making information more accessible, clearer, and more comprehensive for the broader public. The fight against disinformation represents a key challenge of our time. In an environment where opinions are increasingly intertwined with facts, the role of professional and responsible media is pivotal. In this regard, we consider the media as a key partner in pursuing a shared objective: ensuring accurate information and enhancing economic and financial literacy across society. Looking ahead, the priorities of the Bank of Albania remain clear. Monetary and financial stability will continue to stand at the core of our mandate. In parallel, we will intensify our efforts to modernise payment systems, advance digitalisation and further align with European standards, with a view to supporting Albania's continued integration into the European Union. Dear guests, This meeting also provides an opportunity to thank you for your accurate and professional collaboration throughout the year. Your critiques, questions and analyses help us to communicate more clearly, act more responsibly and maintain greater transparency. Open dialogue with the media remains a crucial element in the effective functioning of a central bank. Wishing you ongoing success in your work and a very prosperous end of the year, I am confident that our constructive collaboration will endure in the years ahead, supporting both public information and the economic stability of the country. We will now turn to a specific point on the agenda of this meeting. It is with pleasure that we announce the winners of the ""Governor's Award for the Best Diploma Thesis"", a long-standing tradition of the Bank of Albania that underscores our commitment to promoting both scientific research and academic excellence. This year, 38 students submitted their undergraduate and master's theses, presenting well-structured and insightful research on topics of particular relevance to policymakers, society, and the private sector in Albania. These studies provide significant added value by addressing current and pressing issues, offering well-founded conclusions, and proposing practical solutions. We are pleased to note a considerable increase in the number of theses that approach these topics through empirical analysis. Students not only make judicious use of existing information and databases but also enhance them through surveys and other statistical research, thereby strengthening both the quality and reliability of their findings. As a result, the Committee finds the task of selecting the most outstanding works increasingly challenging, given the high calibre of submissions received. I congratulate you on your outstanding work and encourage you to apply the knowledge and skills you have demonstrated with dedication and insight in the institutions you will serve in the future. With my sincere thanks once again, I am pleased to proceed with the announcement of this year's awards.

A recent Microsoft study reports that 64 percent of the UAE’s working age population uses AI, which is the highest rate globally. This illustrates the dynamism we see in the region—and the major investments and partnerships that some of the world’s biggest tech companies are making here. Why such a huge commitment to this region? Because the UAE and the members of the GCC all understand just how transformative AI can be. They have made systemically significant investments in human capital over the last decades. IMF estimates show that, with the right measures in place, AI could fuel a boost to global productivity of up to 0.8 percentage points per year. This could raise global growth to levels exceeding those of the pre-pandemic period. Here in the Gulf region, AI could boost non-oil GDP in Gulf countries even more, by up to 2.8 percent. For economies that have long been dependent on hydrocarbon exports, this presents an enormous opportunity to diversify and build new sources of growth. Now, major technology changes often bring disruption. And sure enough, we can expect disruption from AI. Especially to labor markets. On average, 40 percent of jobs globally will be impacted by AI - either upgraded, or eliminated or transformed. For advanced economies, 60 percent of jobs will be affected. This is like a tsunami hitting the labor market. We are already seeing the evidence: about one in 10 job postings in advanced economies now require at least one new skill. Workers with in-demand skills will likely see productivity and wage gains. This will create more demand for services, and increase employment and wages among low-skilled workers. But middle-skilled jobs will be squeezed. That means that young people and the middle class will be hit hardest. We can expect to see a similar divergence between countries. Those with an economic structure conducive to AI adoption—that is, strong digital infrastructure, more skilled labor forces, and robust regulatory frameworks—are likely to experience the largest and fastest benefits. Countries that don’t may get left behind. This is why we gathered here today. AI looks unstoppable. But whether or not countries can successfully capitalize on AI’s enormous promise is yet to be determined. And this will largely depend on the policy regimes they put in place. So then, what must be done to ensure AI translates into broad-based prosperity for this region? First, macro policies. Investment and innovation in AI will boost growth. Fiscal policies can support this by strengthening tax systems and by funding research, reskilling, or sector-based training programs. However, tax systems should not encourage automation at the expense of people. Likewise, effective financial regulation will be essential to ensure financial market efficiency and improved risk management. Second, guardrails. AI needs to be regulated to ensure it’s safe, fair, and trustworthy—but without stifling innovation. Different countries are taking different approaches, ranging from risk-based frameworks to high-level principles. Whatever approach they take, it’s critical that countries coordinate. That brings me to my third point: cooperation and partnerships. Scale is a big advantage in AI. But you can’t get scale without cooperation among governments, AI researchers and developers, including when it comes to data sharing and knowledge transfer. Let me conclude. AI will transform our economies. It will present immense opportunities and pose significant risks. And it falls to you, the world’s policymakers, to ensure that the opportunities are maximized for your countries and the risks controlled. Thank you.

The authorities have consented to the publication of the Staff Report prepared for this consultation.[2] Poland has shown significant resilience to recent global shocks. The primary driver for growth has been private consumption due to a strong rebound in real wages. Fiscal stimulus in recent years has also played a role. These expansionary forces have been partially counterbalanced by appropriately tight monetary policy which dampened private investment. In addition, while direct exposure to US tariffs is limited, export growth has been moderate, largely due to soft EU demand. The current account has fallen to 1 percent of GDP deficit, reflecting a rapid increase in imports. Fiscal imbalances have widened considerably. In 2025, the fiscal deficit and public debt are projected to reach 7 percent and 59 percent of GDP, respectively. Poland has the second largest fiscal deficit in Europe this year even though the output gap is largely closed. The widening of the fiscal deficit since 2021 solely reflects a substantial increase in expenditures. Spending now matches levels in advanced European economies—despite differences in composition—while revenues remain closer to levels seen in Central and Eastern Europe. Disinflation is on track helping support monetary policy normalization. Headline and core inflation returned to the target, driven by goods, while services inflation has remained elevated. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored in consumer and producer surveys. With this progress in disinflation, the National Bank of Poland’s (NBP) has gradually reduced policy rates by 175 bps to 4 percent in 2025. The gradual monetary easing has supported credit recovery with banks remaining well capitalized, liquid and profitable, while non-performing loans are declining. Executive Board Assessment[3] Poland’s near-term outlook is favorable, with growth projected to accelerate to 3.3 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2026, driven by a sharp increase in EU fund execution and monetary easing. Inflation has declined into the target range, and the output gap is expected to close in 2026. Nonetheless, risks remain elevated, including fiscal vulnerabilities, declining price competitiveness, global trade developments and regional security concerns. Staff assesses the external position in 2025 to be broadly in line with the levels implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Over time, growth is expected to moderate as EU-financed investment wanes and fiscal consolidation continues. Stabilizing public debt should be a key priority. Under current policies, debt is projected to rise significantly above the EU benchmark of 60 percent of GDP, reaching 78 percent of GDP by 2031. Staff recommends a cumulative fiscal adjustment of 4 percent of GDP to reverse this trend. The composition of consolidation depends on Poland’s social preferences regarding the size and role of the state. The recent widening of the deficit stems entirely from net higher spending—driven by expanded social benefits, a better-compensated public sector, and increased defense outlays. Poland must either raise more revenue to sustain these services or return to a leaner public sector with more efficient and targeted spending. Building on recent gains in fiscal transparency, establishing a well-resourced and independent fiscal council would strengthen fiscal governance. The disinflation process is proceeding well, but monetary policy should now proceed cautiously. Services inflation remains elevated, and economic activity is set to accelerate. Staff advocates a wait-and-see approach to allow time to observe incoming data and to ensure that inflation remains close to the mid-point of the target range on a sustained basis. If economic activity and core inflation begin to fall in a manner that suggests inflation might undershoot the lower end of the target range, further easing would be advisable. Throughout, we see MPC communication that underscores the decision-making process as more constructive than specific predictions for rates. The banking sector is stable and well-capitalized, but there is scope to reduce frictions to credit provision. While credit is recovering, structural barriers—including legal risks and distortionary taxation—continue to constrain financial intermediation. In this regard, staff welcomes the recent reduction in the bank asset tax and encourages going further by eliminating it in a fiscally neutral manner. The objectives of the recently introduced Long-Term Funding Ratio have merit but should be redesigned to avoid unintended consequences that would raise the cost of credit and further undermine credit creation. In addition, legal risks around mortgage contracts should be addressed through proportionate penalties and standardized templates to reduce uncertainty and improve access to credit. Structural reforms at both the national and EU levels are critical to sustaining convergence. Poland’s labor productivity growth remains strong, but innovation lags and demographic pressures are mounting. Staff recommends measures to enhance labor mobility, digital skills, and participation, including gradual increases in the retirement age and better integration of migrant workers. Capital market reforms should improve household returns and expand firm financing. The OKI and Innovate Poland initiatives are promising but should avoid excessive home bias and promote broad participation. Deeper EU integration—especially in energy and capital markets—will support productivity and resilience. While Poland has made progress on decarbonization, further efforts are needed to meet climate targets and preserve competitiveness. Table 1.

The Czech economy continues to expand at a robust pace but faces mounting structural headwinds.","February 3, 2026 A Concluding Statement describes the preliminary findings of IMF staff at the end of an official staff visit (or ‘mission’), in most cases to a member country. Missions are undertaken as part of regular (usually annual) consultations under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, in the context of a request to use IMF resources (borrow from the IMF), as part of discussions of staff monitored programs, or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments. Prague, Czech Republic. The Czech economy continues to expand at a robust pace but faces mounting structural headwinds. Increasing global competition, high concentration of trading partners and export products, and elevated energy intensity leave the economy exposed to external shocks, while adverse demographic trends weigh on potential growth. Although public debt is moderate, preserving fiscal space in this uncertain environment is essential. A significant fiscal stimulus at a time when the economy is already operating at or near potential would likely fuel inflation and lead to higher interest rates. Conversely, advancing structural reforms at the national level and deepening integration within the EU Single Market would raise potential growth and ease the burden of future fiscal consolidation. Monetary policy should remain on hold in the near term, unless incoming data, including wage developments or changes in fiscal policy, materially alter the inflation outlook. While financial stability risks are currently contained, they warrant close vigilance and call for recalibration of some instruments in the macroprudential toolkit as risks evolve. Recent Developments The Czech economy expanded in 2025, driven primarily by domestic demand. Growth was robust, averaging an estimated 2.5 percent, as real wages continued to recover from their post-pandemic decline, supporting household consumption. Public investment also strengthened, on the back of sustained absorption of EU funds. In contrast, private investment and export growth moderated amid heightened global policy uncertainty and rising trade barriers, following a period of front-loaded external demand earlier in the year. Headline inflation has eased, but core inflation remains sticky. At year-end, headline inflation stood at 2.1 percent, broadly in line with the CNB’s inflation target, while core inflation edged up to 2.8 percent, driven by persistently elevated services price growth, including housing-related costs. Sustained nominal wage growth, around 7 percent, continues to exert upward pressure on services prices, where labor is a key input. Outlook and Risks Growth is projected to level off and gradually moderate in the medium term. GDP is expected to expand at a similar pace in 2026, closing the output gap. Consumption should remain strong in the near term, as real wages continue to recover and the saving rate declines slightly. Fixed investment is set to pick up, supported by lower interest rates, while exports are expected to recover more gradually following recent trade disruptions. As export performance strengthens but the catch-up in household income fades, medium-term growth is projected to slow toward its estimated potential of 1.8 percent, constrained by demographic pressures and modest productivity gains. Inflation is expected to undershoot the CNB’s 2 percent target in the near term. Staff project headline inflation to fall below 2 percent this year, supported by the removal of the renewable energy surcharge and lower energy prices. Core inflation, however, is expected to decline more gradually, reflecting persistent wage growth and housing-related cost pressures. Staff’s forecast is subject to considerable uncertainty, with near-term risks to both growth and inflation skewed to the upside and medium-term risks tilted to the downside. A shift toward more expansionary fiscal policy could temporarily raise growth further above potential, fueling services and property price inflation and potentially triggering higher wage claims. The size of these effects would depend on the composition of spending and its import content. The required monetary tightening in response to such a shock would help anchor inflation expectations but would also weigh on growth over time, while wider sovereign spreads could raise borrowing costs. Conversely, persistent global policy uncertainty, trade disputes, or a correction in global asset valuations could dampen growth and increase inflation volatility. Fiscal Policy—Balancing Social Priorities with Fiscal Sustainability The 2026 budget implies a moderately expansionary fiscal stance. The revised budget envisages higher spending on social benefits and transport infrastructure, partly financed through lower than previously planned defense outlays and the postponement of financial commitments related to the Dukovany nuclear power plant expansion. While budgetary accruals remain uncertain, especially regarding the timing of military equipment procurement, staff project the general government deficit to widen to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2026, compared with an estimated 2 percent in 2025, consistent with a moderate fiscal expansion. Significant spending pressures are set to build steadily over the coming years, underscoring the need for fiscal consolidation. Aging-related expenditures and sizable investment needs to strengthen energy security are projected to weigh increasingly on the fiscal position, and a rollback of the recent pension reform would add further strain. Absent consolidation, the public debt ratio would approach 60 percent by 2034, with gross financing needs rising persistently and eroding fiscal space. Staff therefore recommend an annual fiscal adjustment of 0.5 percentage points during 2027-30 to converge toward a sustained structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP, which would stabilize the debt ratio below 50 percent by 2030. Maintaining the deficit at this level through 2040 amid mounting expenditure pressures would require additional measures of roughly 1.5 percent of GDP, bringing total consolidation needs to around 3.5 percent of GDP. Delays in initiating consolidation would further increase the required adjustment. Social priorities should be pursued in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability. Staff urge the authorities to assess carefully the implications of capping the retirement age and modifying pension indexation parameters. Containing growth in the public sector wage bill, including at the local government level, remains essential to safeguard fiscal space. Efforts to address affordability and demographic challenges are welcome. However, strengthening means-testing to improve targeting of social benefits would help ensure that support reaches low-income households while containing fiscal costs. Staff also encourage the authorities to explore efficiency gains through comprehensive spending reviews and by reallocating expenditures toward more productive uses. Ongoing efforts to strengthen tax compliance should be complemented by a broader reassessment of the tax structure. Staff welcome the initiative to reintroduce electronic registration of sales to bolster compliance and reduce tax evasion, especially in sectors with high cash transactions. These measures would be even more effective if accompanied by further digitalization of tax processes. Staff also see merit in rebalancing the tax structure: social security contributions account for nearly half of total revenue, while property tax collection remains among the lowest in the EU, at 0.3 percent of GDP (compared to an OECD average of around 1.7 percent). Transitioning to a value-based property tax system would help curb speculative demand, activate idle housing, and enhance housing market efficiency. Part of the additional revenue from such a reform could be used by municipalities to improve the quality of services and be directed toward social housing investment, helping ease affordability pressures. Monetary Policy—Managing Risks through Scenario Analysis Staff assess the current monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate. While headline inflation is projected to fall below target, persistently elevated core inflation and a closing output gap leave limited room for further easing. The current 3.5 percent policy rate lies within the range of neutral rate estimates, and the lagged impact of a stronger koruna provides restraint. Monetary policy should therefore remain on hold, unless incoming data, including wage developments or changes in fiscal policy, materially alter the inflation outlook. Elevated domestic and global uncertainty underscores the importance of integrating scenario analysis more systematically into policy deliberations. Staff welcome the CNB’s review of its monetary policy analytical and modeling framework, aimed at diversifying methodologies and strengthening scenario-based approaches. In this context, the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework offers a useful lens for assessing appropriate policy responses to shocks. An application of the framework to the Czech Republic suggests that, in the event of a correction in global asset valuations leading to currency depreciation, reserves could be used in combination with tighter monetary policy to mitigate inflationary pressures and output losses rather than relying only on the policy rate. Conversely, a domestic fiscal expansion that contributes to the buildup of macroeconomic imbalances should be countered exclusively with tighter monetary policy and strengthened communication to keep inflation expectations anchored. Staff reiterate the importance of central bank balance sheet normalization over time. The CNB maintains an outsized balance sheet with reserves exceeding 300 percent of the IMF’s ARA metric, largely a legacy of the 2013-17 exchange rate floor. The central bank has been managing large excess koruna liquidity through standard repo operations, limiting reserve sales in a shallow FX market to minimize the impact on the exchange rate. While this approach has preserved policy transmission, it has entailed significant costs, especially during periods of elevated interest rates, when the remuneration of repo operations exceeds returns on FX reserves. Large reserve holdings also expose the CNB balance sheet to exchange rate movements. The CNB has diversified its FX reserves to include higher-yield assets, raising returns but also market and credit risk. Staff therefore reiterate the case for considering a gradual balance sheet normalization through a transparent mechanism of preannounced, small, and regular FX sales. This would still leave sizable reserves against future shocks. Risks of a more expansionary fiscal policy reinforce the case for balance sheet normalization. Financial Policies—Calibrating Macroprudential Tools with Evolving Risks Financial stability risks remain contained but have risen amid real estate developments and elevated interconnectedness. The recovery in household real incomes is supporting repayment capacity, and new mortgages are predominantly extended to high-income households, whose accumulated savings provide a buffer even at elevated debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratios. Banks’ lending standards remain prudent. Nonetheless, rapid property price growth, driven in part by factors outside the mortgage market, and the expanding presence of institutional investors, have broader financial stability implications and warrant close vigilance. The bank-sovereign nexus also merits attention. Czech government securities are issued exclusively on the domestic market, which helps absorb structural excess liquidity but increases interconnectedness risks. Rising financial stability risks point to a need to recalibrate some instruments in the macroprudential toolkit. Staff welcome the CNB’s recent recommendations to tighten loan-to-value and debt-to-income (DTI) limits for investment mortgages, given their higher risk profile, and urge continued close monitoring of the buy-to-let segment. While current risks remain contained, these measures can help prevent a further buildup of vulnerabilities. Should the share of investment mortgages in new lending continue to grow, the CNB could consider additional measures. These may include recommending regionally differentiated limits or reactivating DSTI and DTI limits more broadly. The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is a less effective instrument to address mortgage-specific risks; however, a further broad-based upswing in the financial cycle extending to corporate credit, would warrant increasing the CCyB rate above the current 1.25 percent. Accessing the Eurobond market may help diversify the investor base of Czech sovereign securities, while meeting increasing FX funding needs related to defense and energy investments. Structural Policies—Supporting Growth and Complementing Fiscal Consolidation Facing mounting structural headwinds, the Czech Republic is gradually transitioning from a manufacturing-driven, export-oriented hub to a more mature and diversified economy, with ICT and financial services gaining importance. While a significant fiscal stimulus when the economy is at or near potential could fuel inflation, advancing structural reforms at the national level, alongside deeper integration within the EU Single Market, would boost potential growth and ease the burden of fiscal consolidation. Sustaining this progress while ensuring resilience in traditional sectors will require a better allocation of skilled labor to address shortages, deeper capital markets, reliable energy supply, and affordable housing. The mission would like to thank the Czech authorities for their warm hospitality, open collaboration, and fruitful discussions.

He outlines the Bank’s role in maintaining low and stable inflation while helping the economy through the transition.","Structural change—Canada at a crossroads Introduction Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back at the Empire Club to deliver my first speech of the year. And what a year it’s shaping up to be. Last week, the Bank of Canada held its policy rate at 2¼%—and we had two key messages. First, our economic outlook has not changed much since last fall, but uncertainty around our forecast has increased. We continue to expect the Canadian economy to grow modestly and inflation to stay close to the 2% target. But geopolitical risks are heightened, and US trade policy remains unpredictable. Second, the Canadian economy is adjusting to US protectionism. Canadian businesses are looking for new suppliers and new markets. This restructuring, which includes shifting our trade and integrating our internal market, will take some time. But in time, it will strengthen our economy. Today, I want to focus on this second theme—structural change and what it means for the Canadian economy. Canada is at a crossroads. The era of rules-based open trade with the United States is over, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) looms large, and our demographics are shifting. The impact of these forces on the Canadian economy will not be a temporary cyclical fluctuation. These are deep structural changes that are transforming the economic landscape. And how Canada responds—which road we take—will define our economic future. The Bank of Canada needs to understand the economic implications of structural change to deliver on our mandate—low and stable inflation. Governments need to understand it to direct public investment, encourage private investment and use industrial policy to capitalize on our economic strengths. Businesses need to understand it to develop new markets and products, invest in productivity-enhancing technology and help their workers gain skills for the future. And Canadians need to understand it so they can see the opportunity, while managing what could be difficult adjustments along the way. That’s a lot to navigate in a short speech, so let me break it down into three manageable questions. First, what do we expect for the economy this year and next—what does structural change mean for growth, jobs and inflation? Second, where do we see adjustments already happening, and what could be in store in the years ahead? And finally, what are the monetary policy implications? This last question is important because monetary policy should not try to mitigate structural change. Our role is to preserve price stability while supporting the economy through the upheaval. That’s easy to say, but hard to do in the moment. What is structural change? Before I tackle these three big questions, I want to start by defining what we mean by structural change. Things are always changing in the economy. Oil prices, the stock market and exchange rates go up and down. Consumer and business sentiment shifts. And the strength of the global economy ebbs and flows. But these changes are not structural change. Structural change is bigger and broader—and it’s not temporary. It permanently changes the level or composition of economic activity. It alters what and how much the Canadian economy can produce at full capacity without causing inflation. Structural change is a journey. It’s the transition between one steady state and the next—between Canada’s old economy and the new one taking shape. In truth, the economy is always adjusting to structural forces like new technology. Most of the time structural change is gradual and relatively smooth. It’s operating in the background. But sometimes structural change is more prominent because the pace of change is unusually rapid. This can happen because of a fundamental policy shift—such as the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement in 1989—or the dawn of a new transformative technology like the internet in the 1990s. Today is one of those times of rapid change—we are facing a convergence of structural breaks. Advances in AI have dramatically broadened its application, the United States has swerved to protectionism, and our population growth has declined. Structural change can be disruptive, rendering some investments obsolete and displacing some workers. And spillovers from sectors that are restructuring can create cyclical weakness in other parts of the economy. Structural change can also increase uncertainty because it’s hard to know how transformative it will be. When the internet emerged in the 1990s, we didn’t know just how valuable the new technology would be or which investments would pay off. Even as the internet proved to be an enormously powerful new technology, the dot-com bust of 2000 was a painful reminder that many new companies could fail. Like the internet, AI is a transformative technology, and its rise has sparked concerns about over-investment and over-valuation as well as fears of job destruction. But just as the internet enabled new services and business models that boosted productivity, the rise of AI has the potential to put the economy on a higher path and raise our standard of living. While AI is building on past innovation, the US swerve to protectionism is reversing gains from trade. When Canada embarked on free trade with the United States in 1989, it did bring some pain in the short term—competition can be tough. But, in time, a bigger market and new competition brought innovation and investment, increasing productivity and growth and lowering inflation. 1 Now, new US trade restrictions are reducing efficiency, raising costs and lowering incomes in Canada. Trend growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is also being pulled down by lower population growth, which reflects both a decline in fertility and lower rates of immigration. That means fewer new consumers and workers in the economy, which lowers our economic potential. The Bank’s population forecast suggests the Canadian labour force will hardly grow at all over the next few years after annual growth of almost 1½% on average for the past 20 years. Looking back at history makes identifying structural breaks look deceptively easy. But identifying what is happening in real time is challenging because structural change happens at the same time as cyclical changes in demand and supply. That makes it hard for businesses, workers, governments and central banks to know which change is temporary and which is permanent—and hence where to invest and how to set policy. I’ll come back to the policy implications momentarily. Canada’s economic outlook But first, let’s consider the first question: what does structural change mean for the economy over the next couple of years? Last week, the Bank released its quarterly Monetary Policy Report , including our economic outlook for 2026 and 2027. US tariffs have weakened our economy. Exports are down sharply. And while some export growth is expected to resume this year, exports grow along a lower path ( Chart 1 ). The trade conflict has also spilled over to the broader economy. Business investment has been weak across sectors—largely because of elevated uncertainty. But investment is expected to strengthen as businesses adapt to the new trade environment and governments increase infrastructure spending. Household spending is also expected to grow moderately, supported by past cuts in interest rates and rising disposable incomes. Adding it all up, the economy is forecast to grow—but it’s soft growth. We expect GDP growth to average only about 1¼% over the next two years. Part of this softness reflects cyclical weakness and part reflects structural change. The lower US demand for Canadian exports and trade-related uncertainty has spilled over into lower business investment and hiring. But tariffs have also increased costs and reduced the efficiency of the economy. And lower immigration means less labour force growth. In our baseline forecast, the spillover effects from the trade shock and uncertainty gradually dissipate and the economy recovers from the cyclical weakness. But the path for potential output is lower because of increased trade friction and slower population growth. Turning to jobs, we expect businesses to be cautious in their hiring this year. But with little growth in the labour force, we are not expecting the unemployment rate to trend higher. Indeed, with modest economic growth, we should see some gradual improvement in the labour market over the projection. But structural change means this improvement could be uneven across sectors and occupations. I’ll come back to this. Inflation is expected to remain close to the 2% target. Tariffs and the costs of reconfiguring trade are putting some upward pressure on inflation. But the cyclical weakness in demand is constraining price increases. With the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement under review this year, uncertainty will continue to weigh on the economy. And broader geopolitical risks are elevated. We could see a lot of worrying headlines—and uncertainty makes it hard for businesses to invest. But some things are clear. The United States has rejected open trade, population growth has slowed, and AI will change the marketplace. And when the economic landscape changes, Canadian businesses need to adjust. Recent federal and provincial budgets include measures to help businesses pivot, support workers in the transition and help the economy restructure. These policy measures are included in our economic outlook, along with past interest rate cuts and other announced fiscal measures. As the Canadian economy works through this transition, growth will be modest. In time, the economy restructures and productivity and potential output pick up, but this will be measured in years, not quarters. The transition could be faster than we expect, particularly if trade uncertainties ease and businesses move more boldly to invest in new technology, markets and products. But it could also be more painful than we’d like—particularly if the trade situation darkens or other shocks disrupt the economy. Worse still, the Canadian economy could fail to restructure. If that happens, productivity and GDP growth do not recover. Canada becomes a less attractive place to invest. Businesses become less competitive. Job and wage growth are weak, our incomes don’t recover, and affordability worsens. That’s what we really can’t afford. That’s why we need to lean into this structural change. Structural change, sectoral adjustment and supply That brings me to the second question: Where do we see adjustment already happening? I’ll start with trade. As we approach the one-year mark of US tariff threats, supply chains have started to shift. Goods imports from the United States have declined, while those from other countries have increased ( Chart 2 ). That decline in imports from the United States has mostly happened in sectors affected by Canada’s retaliatory tariffs—we’re diversifying to avoid higher costs. There are also indications our imports from overseas are being rerouted to avoid going through the United States. Increasingly, we’re getting them directly. Exports too, are shifting, though not as quickly. Exports of goods to non-US markets have risen, while exports to the US have fallen ( Chart 3 ). A small but growing share of exporters have increased sales to overseas markets. So far, the increase is largely limited to existing clients—businesses have not found many new clients just yet. And with so much of our exports going to the United States, the increase in other markets only provides a partial offset. You can see this in the large overall decline in our exports ( Chart 1 ). You can also see it in the labour market. Employment in sectors with high exposure to trade fell in the first half of last year and remains subdued ( Chart 4 ). It's still early days. It will take time to develop new markets, and the transition will weigh on our export sector. It is encouraging that businesses have started adapting, but there is a long way to go. The changes brought by AI are not as easy to capture. We’re certainly seeing some AI investment, and we expect efficiencies brought by AI will ultimately boost productivity. AI will also likely affect the labour market, and we’re watching that closely. So far, it’s too early to see significant AI impacts on productivity or employment in Canada. But we are seeing a few early indicators of change. AI adoption looks to be increasing in Canada but remains modest. When we talk to companies, they tell us their workers are increasingly using AI at work. But significant adoption of AI to produce or deliver goods and services remains low. Statistics Canada’s Survey on Business Conditions puts this at 12% of businesses. Our most recent Business Leaders’ Pulse survey yielded broadly similar responses. Only 8% of businesses surveyed reported significant AI use in their operations, with another 11% reporting plans to use AI over the next year. But the majority had either no use or infrequent use of AI. And while AI may be expected to boost productivity at some point, it may be a while before we see a significant impact. So far, we are not seeing much impact of AI in the labour market either. 2 Not surprisingly, we are seeing increased demand for workers with AI skills. 3 The flip side is we may be seeing some early evidence that AI is reducing the number of entry-level jobs in some occupations. And this may be boosting youth unemployment, although separating the effects of AI from the impact of trade and demographic changes is difficult. There are more media reports that professional services companies are cutting back on entry-level positions because AI can do some of the work. And there is some hard evidence that it is getting more difficult to find a job in occupations with a larger proportion of tasks that can be performed by AI ( Chart 5 ). At the same time, we are seeing a decline in the share of entry-level job vacancies ( Chart 6 ). Long-term youth unemployment is also elevated. As we monitor employment through this structural change, it’s important to remember that technological progress doesn’t just benefit companies at the expense of workers. Canadians benefit too. Productivity growth pays for higher wages. And recent innovations have given us more choice for less cost. The internet brought instant communication, e-commerce at our fingertips, GPS warnings of traffic ahead, crowdsourced reviews and online bookings for everything. AI holds similar promise for new goods and services and lower cost. Monetary policy implications With structural change underway and lots of runway ahead, we come to the third question: What are the implications for monetary policy? Recall our definition of structural change: it’s the transition from Canada’s old economy to the new one that’s taking shape. Monetary policy can’t change the destination. But it can help smooth the journey. Let me explain. The Bank of Canada is helping the economy through this restructuring, while keeping inflation low and stable. Monetary policy can support demand that’s being restrained by spillovers and cyclical weakness. What monetary policy can’t do is restore the lost efficiency caused by increased trade friction. Monetary policy isn’t going to have much effect on the adoption of AI either. And monetary policy certainly can’t influence fertility or immigration rates. But what’s clear in principle is more complicated in practice. Several realities complicate monetary policy in the face of structural change. I’ll focus on two. First, it is hard to differentiate structural change from cyclical fluctuations as they are happening. In the short term, structural change is hard to see through the ups and downs in the economy—so it can be hard to know whether a drop in GDP growth is part of a structural trend or a temporary downturn. We have to be careful not to misdiagnose economic weakness. Monetary policy should not try to compensate for lost supply. Lowering interest rates in the face of weak economic activity risks stoking future inflation if the weakness is due to lower productive capacity rather than a cyclical downturn in demand. And there is also a risk that overstimulating demand when the problem is structural could delay needed structural change. Second, by its nature, structural change will affect different sectors and workers differently. We can’t just look at the average impacts. US tariffs are already hitting the economy very unevenly. AI is poised to disrupt some industries and occupations more than others. Experience has taught us that these sectoral differences are important to understand inflation. For example, strong demand in some sectors may boost inflation by more than weakness elsewhere lowers it. Navigating the transition will require a lot of careful analysis and thoughtful judgment. We have to look beyond the aggregate and dig into more granular data to see how workers and capital are moving across sectors and regions. The dynamics of the labour market can offer important clues about what’s cyclical and what’s structural. While cyclical downturns always affect some jobs more than others, experience tells us that cyclical downturns result in a broad-based weakness in the labour market. So if unemployment, job vacancies, separations and finding rates are unusually different across sectors, occupations and demographic groups, it suggests structural change is at play. Our surveys of businesses and consumers will also help identify how capital is shifting, jobs are changing and workers are adjusting. And given that Canada’s main industrial sectors are concentrated in different parts of the country, our regional analysis and outreach will be important. Finally, we need multi-sector models to understand the monetary policy implications of structural change. Since the pandemic, we’ve developed richer models that capture sectoral differences and the links between sectors. More granular analysis, continued regional outreach and richer models will all help us separate what is cyclical and what is structural. Even so, the confluence of geopolitical, demographic and technical change increases the risks of getting it wrong. That’s why we’re using more scenario analysis. It allows us to explore alternative interpretations and reduce the risk of policy errors. And we will be ready to respond if new information changes our outlook. In short, we’ll be working hard to identify and assess the relative importance of cyclical and structural changes. Through it all, our 2% inflation target will remain our ultimate policy beacon. Conclusion It’s time to wrap up. I began my speech by acknowledging the heightened uncertainty we continue to face. This is making it difficult for businesses, families and communities to plan and prepare for the future—but we need to play the new hand we’ve been dealt, not the one we had. Even with increased uncertainty, the structural forces of US protectionism, new AI-driven technology and shifting demographics are unmistakable. How Canadian households, businesses and governments respond to these structural breaks will determine our future prosperity. We can be victims of US tariffs and AI disruption, or we can lean into structural change, expand our internal market, diversify our trade, embrace new technology and raise our productivity. Monetary policy will not be at the centre of the action. But the Bank of Canada will play a supporting role. Our focus is on maintaining low and stable inflation while helping the economy through this period of structural change. And it’s on managing through this period of elevated uncertainty. That means being alive to the risks and prepared to adjust if the outlook changes. Thank you.

Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%. Although above the 2% target currently, CPI inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April, owing to developments in energy prices including from Budget 2025. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease. The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. Monetary policy is being set to ensure that CPI inflation not only reaches 2% but remains sustainably at that level in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this. The restrictiveness of policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. The extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 4 February 2026 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussed key economic developments and its judgements around them, as well as its views on monetary policy strategy. The latest data and analysis underpinning these topics were set out in the accompanying February 2026 Monetary Policy Report . The Committee’s discussions 2: The Committee’s policy discussions at this meeting focused on: the near-term outlook for inflation, and its implications for underlying price and wage pressures; the role of slack in the economy in helping to keep inflation at the target in the medium term; and the appropriate response of monetary policy, taking into account these factors as well as broader strategic considerations. 3: CPI inflation had fallen from 3.8% in September last year to 3.4% in December. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy, wage growth and services price inflation had generally continued to ease, albeit remaining above target-consistent levels. CPI inflation was expected to fall back to around the 2% target from April. This mainly reflected developments in energy prices, including the impact of measures announced in Budget 2025. This near-term outlook was notably lower than had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report, although there had been less news relative to the MPC’s December meeting. 4: UK import prices were also contributing slightly to the projected decline in CPI inflation this year, including as US tariffs and previous energy price falls were weighing on global export price growth. Uncertainty around the global outlook remained. 5: All members of the Committee continued to stress the importance of inflation not only reaching but remaining sustainably at the 2% target in the medium term. Members had different views on the extent to which the near-term reduction in headline inflation, which predominantly reflected one-off factors, would be sufficient to curb remaining risks of persistence in underlying inflationary pressures. 6: For some members, the prospective reduction in headline inflation, particularly in categories such as energy and food that remained salient for households, could feed through quickly to inflation expectations and lead to continued normalisation of wage and price-setting. These members also pointed to pay settlements in the Agents’ pay survey slowing to 3.4% this year, close to target-consistent levels. However, other members were more concerned about still-elevated inflation expectations and a range of future wage indicators, despite disinflation to date. If such inflationary pressures persisted, monetary policy would need to remain more restrictive to avoid inflation settling above the target in the medium term. Most members put some weight on Bank staff analysis that had found little evidence of structural changes in wage bargaining over the recent period. 7: The extent to which remaining excess domestic inflationary pressures would fall would crucially also be influenced by developments in the labour market and the degree to which economic slack acted against these pressures in the coming years. Underlying GDP growth had remained below estimates of potential, and Agents’ intelligence pointed to a subdued outlook for demand. The labour market had continued to loosen, with the unemployment rate having picked up to just over 5% recently. As a result, the February Report central projection incorporated a slightly wider output gap over the forecast period than had been expected in November. 8: Most members judged that there remained some downside risks around this already weaker outlook, which could widen the output gap further and result in an undershoot in inflation, in the absence of looser monetary policy. Households might remain cautious about spending, with a risk that the saving rate would not fall back as expected. Demand could remain weak and unemployment could increase by more than expected. 9: Other members noted signs of a slowing in the pace of labour market loosening as, for example, vacancies had started to tick up. Weak productivity growth could keep unit labour cost growth elevated and contribute to a narrower output gap than otherwise estimated. And growth in bank lending and broad money had both edged higher, suggesting that monetary policy was not overly restrictive. 10: On balance, the Committee judged that the risk from greater inflation persistence had continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remained. In making this assessment, members had generally been influenced more by new Bank staff analysis, including that published in the February Report, than by the most recent data releases. 11: In considering how monetary policy should be set to balance these risks around inflation settling sustainably at the target, the Committee judged that, on the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate was likely to be reduced further, although there were different views on the timing and extent. Judgements around further policy easing would become a closer call. With uncertainty around how precisely a neutral level of Bank Rate could be estimated, slowing the pace of further easing could provide space to gain assurance about how the risks were evolving. 12: Across possible inflation scenarios, the MPC considered how well different monetary policy paths could insure against adverse economic outcomes. 13: Some members were most concerned that cutting rates too quickly risked inadvertently making policy too accommodative if inflationary pressures did not recede, and that it might be costly to change course in that event. If downside risks were instead to materialise, Bank Rate could still be reduced faster then. Other members were concerned that holding Bank Rate at a restrictive level for too long could require a sharper adjustment in monetary policy later on. Finding clear evidence that structural changes had occurred in the economy would always take a long time to become evident in the data. And waiting too long to change policy in the meantime could come at the cost of a sharper downturn in activity and a significant undershoot in inflation. 14: The Committee noted that the central projection was conditioned on a market curve that fell slightly in 2026 then sloped upwards thereafter, to around 3¾% in 2029. Instead, the median respondent to the Market Participants Survey expected Bank Rate to fall to 3.25% and stay there. Members recognised that the upward slope in market pricing beyond this year, even if it did not solely reflect market expectations of Bank Rate, was providing restriction via firms’ and households’ financing costs. The immediate policy decision 15: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 16: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% at this meeting. These members recognised that progress in disinflation had continued. While the lower near-term outlook for inflation was welcome, it remained to be seen how this would pass through into wage and price-setting in the economy. For three members in this group (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli and Huw Pill), a more prolonged period of policy restriction was likely to be warranted to mitigate the remaining risks that inflation could settle above the target, but they would continue to assess the evidence. The other two members in this group (Andrew Bailey and Catherine L Mann) had greater confidence that this risk would be mitigated by the lower near-term path for inflation and placed greater emphasis on the risks to inflation from weaker activity, but neither member judged that the weight of evidence was yet sufficient to warrant reducing Bank Rate at this meeting. 17: Four members (Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. These members judged that the risk from greater inflation persistence had receded materially, and thought it likely that inflation expectations would normalise once inflation itself returned to around the target. These members attached a greater weight to the risks to inflation from weaker demand. For these members, monetary policy was still too restrictive, and a further cut in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 18: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 3.75%. 19: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members (Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%.

References to scenarios relate to those set out in Section 3 of the November 2025 Report, which have been updated in the February Report. Vote to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% Andrew Bailey: My policy decision is based on accumulating evidence. Despite all the uncertainties in the world, we are not currently facing a situation in which monetary policy is being hit by big new shocks. Activity is subdued against a background of inflation returning to the target. I can see the case for the output gap having widened, but by how much is uncertain. Although survey evidence on activity is pointing to a slightly more positive short-term picture, my central outlook is aligned with the staff’s view of weaker demand, leaving the risks more balanced. The supply side story remains uncertain (Box C). I expect to see quite a sharp drop in inflation over coming months. While I am more confident in the overall path of wage disinflation, it is naturally less clear when and how much the expected upcoming drop in inflation will influence wage settlements (Box B). Overall, the risks from inflation persistence appear to have continued to reduce. I therefore see scope for some further easing of policy. This does not mean that I expect to cut Bank Rate at any particular meeting. I will go into the coming meetings asking whether a cut is justified. Megan Greene: I continue to place more weight on the risk of inflation persistence, preferring to wait for clearer evidence that inflation will settle sustainably at the target before easing policy further. I find it difficult to justify our significant downward revision to slack in this forecast, given year-on-year headline GDP growth surprised to the upside for much of 2025. I also think it unlikely that potential productivity will pick up as assumed (Box C) and put more weight on Bank staff’s smaller output gap sensitivity (Section 3.2). Our central projection requires underlying inflation and wage growth to decline further for inflation to stabilise at the target. I have three primary concerns: forward-looking indicators of wage growth remain above target-consistent rates; firms in the DMP Survey expect little change in their own-price inflation over the next year; and household inflation expectations remain elevated. I would prefer to wait to see that firms and households revise down their inflation expectations in response to lower realised inflation. I continue to think the monetary policy stance is not materially restrictive. Finally, I believe the cost of a policy error is greater if Bank Rate follows the market path and we end up with inflation persistence versus weaker demand. Clare Lombardelli: Overall the data continue broadly to show strength in wages and underlying inflation, weak activity and softening employment. While the near-term fall in CPI inflation should reduce second-round effects, it is not assured that wage growth will return to target-consistent rates (Box A). The recent recovery in productivity is likely cyclical. Structural productivity growth, which has been weak since the financial crisis, may not recover to the extent that Bank staff estimate (Box C). I remain concerned about both upside and downside risks to inflation. The labour market has loosened materially, from an extremely tight starting point, but it is unclear how much downward pressure this is putting on inflation. The current degree of restrictiveness is uncertain (Box E), although evidence on credit does not suggest monetary policy is weighing heavily on the economy. Taken together, I prefer to hold Bank Rate at its current level. I am more concerned about the costs of cutting rates too quickly than too slowly, including the risks to credibility from any potential policy reversal that is not in response to a new shock. Catherine L Mann: New analysis and current developments have moved the appropriate time for a cut in Bank Rate closer. This will partly depend on how various one-off policies (Box D) – which account for half of the projected disinflation between 2025 H2 and 2026 H2 – affect the underlying disinflation process. Wage and price moderation is in train, with one-year ahead expected inflation of income-elastic and discretionary consumer-facing products particularly notable. Some components of CPI inflation have remained above target-consistent rates (Box E), most likely because wage growth is not target-consistent either (Box A). Bank staff analysis on different categories of wage setters suggests that lower inflation should push down on settlements for a significant proportion of private sector workers (Box B). Private sector activity and employment continue to be soft. Consumers have been scarred by high and volatile inflation, which poses a risk to the projected decrease in the saving rate in the central projection. The degree of restrictiveness varies over the time horizon and whether the focus is on real or nominal rates. A cut now would overweight the importance of the near-term mechanical disinflation and risk higher term premia. I look forward to incoming assessments of the constellation of surveys and data ahead of upcoming meetings. Huw Pill: I do not see a need to reduce Bank Rate further at this meeting. This follows from distinguishing between the underlying disinflation process, which remains intact but incomplete, and the risks around that process, which shift through time but have on balance been in the direction of slower disinflation than expected a year or eighteen months ago. In explaining this slowing, I would emphasise the role of structural changes in wage-bargaining and productivity – notwithstanding the conclusions in Box B, where I draw different implications from the careful and important analysis – and a monetary policy stance that has been overly accommodative since the withdrawal of restriction started in August 2024. While I draw comfort about the medium-term inflation outlook from longer-term market inflation expectations and low-frequency broad money dynamics, I remain concerned that inflationary pressures stemming from an overly rapid withdrawal of policy restriction over the past two years still need to be contained and eliminated. In that light, I continue to favour a cautious withdrawal of policy restriction, guided by longer‑term trends rather than short‑term news. Vote to reduce Bank rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5% Sarah Breeden: The significant amount of evidence since December has led to a finely balanced decision. New analysis, rather than new data, has further supported my view that upside risks to inflation have diminished: wage growth is set to end this year at target-consistent levels (Box A); structural change in the labour market now appears less likely to have occurred (Box B); and slack is judged to be a little wider both now and over the forecast. The improved near-term inflation outlook should support a swifter normalisation of wage and price-setting dynamics in an environment of weak demand and labour market slack, as firms and households adjust their expectations towards the target. Upside risks to inflation cannot however be ruled out: inflation expectations may not adjust and potential productivity growth could prove weaker than expected (Box C). But I place greater weight on downside risks, particularly in the near term, including those from an elevated household saving rate and a weakening labour market. I can see a case for taking out some insurance against these downside risks to inflation and think policy should be eased a little faster than implied by the current market path. Swati Dhingra: My inflation outlook is broadly consistent with the central projection, pointing to continued disinflation. The inflation persistence scenario is less compelling given the prevailing weakness in activity and higher-than-expected unemployment. The return of inflation to near-target this year alleviates previous concerns about threshold effects. I expect inflation expectations to reduce once prices and wages have normalised, with little evidence of structural change to the wage-setting process (Box B), especially now that previous cost-push shocks are at some distance. While my central case has the risks around activity broadly balanced, I still find the downside scenario to be a useful exploration of a weaker demand recovery. The impact of weaker demand on slack could nevertheless be limited if the prolonged demand weakness has also weighed on supply growth (Box C), potentially counteracting the risk of an inflation undershoot. But, overall, I still expect monetary policy to contribute to disinflation over the next year. The market-implied path for Bank Rate looks too tight. The costs of making a policy mistake seem much higher on the downside, especially given weak labour demand. And the reverse strategy of holding Bank Rate then cutting aggressively would be no panacea were there to be a sharp downturn in activity and employment. Dave Ramsden: I see risks to the latest central projection for inflation as now tilted to the downside, reflecting the latest evidence and, in particular, the analysis presented in the February Report. Core disinflation is clearly progressing with cumulative weakening in the labour market and subdued activity, consistent with a slightly larger output gap relative to November. This outlook could be weaker if savings and consumption do not normalise, as a result of recent shocks and geopolitical uncertainty, and if there is greater loosening in the labour market than expected. I am increasingly confident that wage growth will fall to target-consistent rates this year (Box A). Falls in headline inflation (Box D) should help cool inflation expectations and ease wage growth further, with little evidence of structural changes affecting wage-setting (Box B). Additionally, productivity growth may pick up to near its long-run trend (Box C). I do not discount upside risks to inflation nor various ongoing uncertainties. However, with my starting point for an estimate of the neutral rate of around 3%, I judge that policy should be less restrictive in order to meet the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Alan Taylor: This is a substantial forecast revision, but the continued drift is more notable. Since February 2025, cumulative revisions for 2026–27 have delivered lower central paths for inflation and greater slack, even as the Bank Rate path on which they were conditioned drifted lower. If the inflation persistence scenario were materialising, the opposite should have happened. This supports my previous outlook, as do other developments. Firstly, inflation is now expected to return to the target this year; some higher-frequency measures suggest we are already close. Secondly, we reach the target much earlier than previously expected (Box D), and falling inflation means that elevated inflation expectations are likely to moderate significantly this year. Thirdly, this is not all due to the one-time shocks dropping out or new fiscal measures kicking in; softer price-wage dynamics and emerging slack also contribute across the forecast period. Together with normalising wages (Boxes A and B), all this reduces or even eliminates the risk of the inflation persistence scenario. I now place even more weight on the central and downside scenarios. If we expect to be at or below the target with significant slack emerging in about six months, a neutral rate of 3% should be in our sights now.

We use it to monitor developments in the economy and to track businesses’ views.","Monthly Decision Maker Panel data - January 2026 The January 2026 DMP survey was conducted between 9-23 January 2026 and received 2,064 responses. Firms reported that their realised annual own-price growth was 3.7% in the three months to January, unchanged from the three months to December. Note that the DMP covers own prices from firms across the whole economy, not just consumer-facing firms. Year-ahead own-price inflation was expected to be 3.5% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points lower than firms reported in the three months to December. Businesses therefore expect output price inflation to slightly fall over the next year, based on three-month averages. Expectations for year-ahead CPI inflation decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 3.2% in the three months to January. The corresponding measure for three-year-ahead CPI inflation expectations was 2.9% in the three months to January, which remained unchanged relative to the three months to December. Firms reported that annual wage growth was 4.4% in the three months to January, unchanged from the three months to December. Expected year-ahead wage growth fell slightly, by 0.1 percentage points to 3.6% in the three months to January. This implies that firms expect their wage growth to decline by 0.8 percentage points over the next 12 months. Firms reported that realised annual employment growth was -0.6% in the three months to January, down from -0.4% in the three months to December. Expectations for employment growth over the next year improved slightly, rising by 0.2 percentage points to -0.2% in the three months to January.

Some sectors continue to expect a modest pickup in real activity in 2026. Employment and pay Employment intentions remain slightly negative. Agents’ pay survey suggests settlements for 2026 to average 3.4%, down from realised average 2025 settlements of 4%. Costs and prices Consumer facing firms see a weakening in inflationary pressures in 2026. Many continue to report squeezed profit margins and ongoing efficiency initiatives as mitigation. Overview This Agents’ summary of business conditions (ASBC) summarises intelligence from the Bank’s Agents considered by the Monetary Policy Committee at its February meeting. The intelligence was gathered in the six weeks to early January. It also includes the outcome of the 2026 Agents’ pay survey, which was in the field from 1 December 2025 to 6 January 2026. Intelligence continues to describe a lacklustre economy. Even though uncertainty reduced a little following the Autumn Budget, contacts’ expectations for real activity have not improved. While some sectors continue to expect a modest pickup in real activity in 2026, consumer-facing contacts and manufacturers seem more pessimistic than the last round owing to rising unemployment and weak demand. A little more spare capacity has opened up within firms over the last couple of months, primarily reflecting weak demand in production and consumer-facing sectors, but business services also report persistently low utilisation relative to pre-pandemic. Employment intentions remain slightly negative. Headcount reduction is mostly via natural attrition, with contacts increasing their use of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to boost productivity and reduce the need for headcount growth. The widespread narrative from contact visits is for pay pressures to ease in 2026. This is supported by the latest Agents’ pay survey which suggests that settlements for 2026 will average 3.4%, compared to respondents’ realised average 2025 settlements of 4%. Consumer-facing firms see a weakening in inflationary pressures in 2026. For goods, this is driven by an expectation of lower food inflation. Consumer services inflation is on track to continue its gradual downward trajectory. Contacts continue to report squeezed margins, with plans to rebuild typically focused on operating efficiencies, owing to weak demand limiting their ability to increase prices. Consumer spending Goods and services sales volumes remain subdued. Most contacts expect demand to remain subdued through 2026, citing rising unemployment and continued cost-of-living concerns. Retailers saw volumes over the festive period as flat to slightly down with any sales growth driven primarily by price. Food performed a little better than non-food, with gift expenditure reported as being well down. Supermarkets continue to see modest volume growth, with consumers remaining cautious about total spend and forgoing treats. Demand for clothing remains slightly negative, with promotions needed to drive demand. Even though furniture and homeware retailers largely report flat demand, consolidation in the sector suggests overall demand is still falling. Demand for white goods remains low and very price sensitive. Technology sales had been growing strongly until the run-up to the Autumn Budget. The automotive market remains in difficulty, with manufacturers having to restrict sales of conventional cars to meet electric vehicle targets, which in turn is leading to consumers keeping cars for longer or choosing used cars over new. Hotels report that occupancy rates remain reasonably high. Pubs and restaurants report continued consumer caution, with customers ordering fewer courses and less alcohol than usual. However, hospitality spending in the run-up to Christmas seems to have been broadly in line with last year, even though seasonal corporate entertainment was weaker. Contacts report relatively robust demand for transport, supported by an ongoing trend towards staff spending more time in the office. Investment Investment appetite remains subdued, with investment plans now more stable but at low levels. Fiscal and wider policy uncertainty remains, even post-Budget, adding to an uncertain economic/demand outlook. References to investment plans being cancelled or postponed have reduced. While uncertainty related to the Autumn Budget has lifted, contacts regard fiscal policy and the wider economic outlook as not conducive to investment. Many plans now focus on ‘essential’ investment, maintenance and catching up on reduced investment during 2024 and 2025. For some, labour costs and skills shortages, and the inherent efficiency gains available continue to motivate automation and updating tech, but others continue to extend replacement cycles and delay investment. Digital spend typically comprises software updates and adoption of AI, rather than hardware upgrades and increasingly counts as operating expenditure. Contacts rarely mention access to or cost of borrowing, or constrained capacity as drivers of investment. Financial pressure receives fewer mentions, although motivation to improve profitability in the near term is holding down capital expenditure for some. Manufactured goods exports continue to contract on last year due to weaker European Union (EU) demand and US tariff‑related disruption, while services export values grow steadily. Manufactured goods exports fell as weaker EU demand, Chinese competition and continued US tariff‑related frictions disrupted trade, though a few firms noted some stabilisation in the US where UK tariffs were comparatively favourable. Chinese demand remains weak, but Middle Eastern and wider Asian markets have held up, and demand from construction, energy, aerospace and defence remains firm. Automotive softness continues. Growth in services export values is supported by professional, IT, construction and energy‑related work. Fewer US visitors have been replaced only in part by lower‑spending EU and Asian tourists. There are reports of diversion of Chinese exports into the UK. Contacts expect modest improvement in 2026 as they shift focus toward India and the Far East alongside expected stabilisation in the US tariff regime. Business and financial services Annual business and financial services revenue growth remains subdued, supported by prices rather than volumes, which remain broadly flat. Confidence is still fragile. IT services continue to grow due to strong demand for AI, cybersecurity and software‑based solutions, though discretionary projects remain on hold. Banking incomes are higher owing to improved net interest margins, and insurance revenue growth remains positive despite premium deflation. Professional services are mixed: restructuring and tax work remain solid, but mergers and acquisitions and property‑related activity continue to be held back by uncertainty. Haulage/logistics are broadly steady, while corporate hospitality revenues are weaker than last year, with Christmas particularly weak. Recruitment demand remains soft, and marketing/advertising revenues have contracted as large corporates reduce discretionary spend. Firms expect broadly similar conditions in early 2026, with hopes of improvement later in the year tempered by concerns around future fiscal policy, weak client confidence, cost pressures and public sector delays. Manufacturing and production Manufacturing and production output remain modestly down on last year, with confidence more subdued than the last round and growth reliant on only a few resilient sectors. Firms report output slightly lower than a year ago as weak confidence, softer orderbooks and higher relative prices continue to weigh on demand. Chemicals, consumer‑facing goods, construction‑related suppliers and capital equipment producers all note persistently low activity. Automotive output has improved as temporary shutdowns unwind, and aerospace remains a key area of resilience, though defence contacts report new orders are slow to progress. Some contacts report pockets of growth linked to renewables, infrastructure and occasional market‑share gains, but these remain limited. Most firms expect output to stay broadly subdued but steady through early 2026, with some scaling back production rather than accepting low‑margin work. Construction Construction activity has weakened further on last year, with housebuilding and commercial development slowing and little improvement expected before late 2026 Contacts report that new‑build housing activity has stalled, held back by weak demand, elevated build and funding costs and persistent planning delays. Commercial development, particularly offices, remains largely paused due to high build and funding costs. Infrastructure activity is modestly positive with schemes subject to delay, while pockets of growth continue in industrial/data‑centre projects, energy schemes and public sector work. Repair and maintenance activity is rising steadily compared to the same period last year, supported by post‑Grenfell regulations. Overall, firms expect conditions to remain subdued through to mid‑2026, with any recovery dependent on lower financing costs, some improvement in planning and improved pipeline of projects. Some warn that capacity constraints could limit the pace of recovery once activity eventually picks up. Corporate credit conditions There is little news on credit availability or demand with weak borrowing appetite still the main constraint, and smaller firms most likely to claim high street bank credit is not available. Contacts continue to describe credit supply as generally good, with high street banks actively seeking to lend, and larger firms raising finance without difficulty. A tail of smaller, weaker‑performing businesses still report pressure from lenders to reduce debt. Credit demand remains subdued as most firms prioritise paying down existing borrowing amid weak confidence and soft investment intentions. High street banks continue to report low borrower distress levels. Insolvencies are expected to remain concentrated in small and medium businesses and largely voluntary. But there are some reports of more late payments, tighter trade‑credit insurance conditions, and rising bad debts in construction and discretionary consumer‑facing sectors. Employment and capacity utilisation Employment intentions remain slightly negative. Recruitment difficulties remain around normal, albeit with some persistent pockets of tightness in some areas. Larger firms are more negative about their employment outlook than smaller ones. Contacts are mainly pursueing headcount reduction via natural attrition, with greater weight placed on technology, automation and AI to boost productivity and mitigate the need for headcount growth. Higher labour costs and the possible impact of the Employment Rights Bill, alongside weak demand, are also causing firms to scrutinise hiring decisions more closely. There are some reports of redundancies, although over a third of those companies visited in recent rounds had already achieved their desired headcount reduction. Employment intentions are strongest for business services and weakest for consumer-facing contacts, with a lot contingent on how the holiday trading period panned out. Reported recruitment difficulties remain around normal on average, with persistent pockets of tightness for some skills and in some locations. Employee churn remains low, reflecting reluctance to move given uncertainty. Contacts report spare capacity has increased over the past couple of months. This primarily reflects weak demand in production and consumer-facing sectors, but business services contacts also report persistently low utilisation rates relative to pre-pandemic. Much of the slack is concentrated in physical capacity, but there are still reports of labour hoarding where skills are scarce. Consistent with this, where Agents do occasionally hear of capacity constraints, they usually relate to skill shortages. Labour costs The average expected pay settlement as reported in the Agents’ pay survey for 2026 is 3.4%, down from the average of 4.0% that respondents say they made in 2025. footnote [1] The widespread message from intelligence gathered in normal contact visits is for pay pressures to ease in 2026, with contacts citing a looser labour market, concerns about profit/affordability, and relatively weak demand. Those with higher expected settlements report these being driven by: National Living Wage (NLW)/ Real Living Wage (RLW), catch-up following previous freezes/low pay awards at the upper end, ongoing recruitment or retention issues in specific areas, trade union activity, and CPI. These messages are broadly supported by the latest Agents’ pay survey. Box A: Agents’ pay survey The Agents’ 2026 pay survey was in the field from 1 December 2025 to 6 January 2026 and gathered 763 responses covering around 1.2 million private sector employees. The average expected settlement for 2026 is 3.4%, down from the average of 4.0% that respondents say they made in 2025 (Chart A), and lower than the 3.6% figure based on the full set of settlements in the Bank’s private sector settlements database. The average expected settlement for 2025 from last year’s survey was 3.7%.

And the proportion of pay settlements greater than 5% has fallen from 23% to 3%, consistent with the smaller increase in NLW this year. The shift in distribution is also evident in pay expectations across all major sectors, which are more uniform for 2026 (a range of 3.1% to 3.6%). This contrasts with reported settlements given last year (a range of 3.3% to 5.2%) which saw consumer facing sectors, driven by NLW/RLW increases, receiving substantially higher average settlements than other sectors (Chart C).

Last year Agents asked firms about the actions they planned to take in response to the, then recently announced, changes in National Insurance contributions (NICs) and NLW, and other labour market policies. This year, the survey asked them what actions they had actually taken. More respondents to this survey said they reduced their headcount, operated on lower margins, and made productivity improvements, than respondents to the previous survey had said they were planning (Chart D). And fewer made lower pay increases. Intelligence since the previous survey suggests the reasons for this likely include higher-than-expected inflation, NLW differentials proving harder to reduce, and union pressures. Weak demand also prevented firms from passing through as much of the rise in labour costs to prices than desired and many had to accept lower margins.

Non-labour costs Cost dynamics continue to support a gradual disinflation path for consumer price inflation. Materials price inflation remains benign. Most contacts expect low single digit increases in materials costs in 2026 and that energy prices will be fairly stable. Imported goods price inflation is currently limited and this is expected to remain the case into 2026, in part due to China’s drive to increase goods production. Most UK manufacturers expect modest output price inflation in 2026. Business-to-business pricing intentions vary, for example haulage firms expect to raise prices by 2%–3% in 2026, while sectors with demand well below normal expect flat or falling prices. Regulated services such as audit are planning price rises to offset wage inflation. For most business services, pricing intentions are for lower increases than in 2025. Firms continue to report squeezed margins, with plans to rebuild focused on operating efficiencies. Consumer prices Consumer-facing firms continue to see a weakening in inflationary pressures in 2026. Despite some volatity at the end of 2025, food price inflation has peaked, and expectations in 2026 are in the range 2% to 4%. Contacts report that costs associated with the Extended Producer Responsibility regulation have been largely passed through into consumer prices; further incremental increases should be significantly less. Non-food consumer goods inflation remains low. Clothing and furniture retailers expect broadly flat prices in 2026. Hospitality and leisure firms mostly report lower planned price increases for 2026, typically around 2% to 4%, reflecting an expectation of more stable costs in 2026 and a continuation of weak demand. Housing The housing market shows slightly firmer sentiment, but activity remains subdued and recovery is expected to be gradual. Estate agents report marginally improved sentiment entering 2026, though there is still little evidence of a pickup in viewings or transactions. The market continues to favour buyers, with supply expected to exceed demand in the near term. Activity remains especially weak in Central London, where higher‑end prices fell sharply last year and remain under pressure, while regions outside the capital expect broadly flat to modest price growth. Rental market inflation continues to moderate, but landlord exits ahead of changes to renters’ rights in England may tighten supply and add to affordability pressures. Outreach engagement Housing, energy and employment concerns continue to dominate households and charities. Many participants describe further sharp rises in the cost of essentials, with energy prices a particular concern in the colder months, and housing costs, especially rents, a pressure point. Younger people and working families cite high day-to-day costs as a major barrier to saving towards a deposit on a first home. Workers and those seeking employment describe a labour market that feels increasingly challenging and fragmented. The perception is that many of the jobs available are low-paid and/or insecure. Seasonal vacancies, particularly in hospitality, are lower than usual, and hybrid working has increased the level of competition candidates face for local jobs. Charities continue to experience high demand for their services, although the demographics of service users has changed with more people facing ‘in-work poverty’.

Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%. Although above the 2% target currently, CPI inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April, owing to developments in energy prices including from Budget 2025. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease. The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. Monetary policy is being set to ensure that CPI inflation not only reaches 2% but remains sustainably at that level in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this. The restrictiveness of policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. The extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. Monetary Policy Overview The Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) job is to ensure that inflation continues to fall back to the 2% target and then stays there. Monetary policy has already helped to bring inflation back towards the target over the past three years. That has allowed the MPC to make monetary policy less restrictive by cutting Bank Rate six times since August 2024. CPI inflation was 3.4% in December. Wage and price pressures have continued to moderate but remain above rates consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Recent developments provide more confidence that inflation is on track to return close to the 2% target soon but the MPC needs to ensure that it stays at the target. The MPC’s policy decisions continue to be shaped by how two big forces play out. On the one hand, the period of high inflation could have affected the way wages and prices are determined in the economy, creating more persistent inflationary pressure. On the other hand, weaker labour demand and subdued household spending could take inflation below the target. Monetary policy is being set to balance these risks so that Bank Rate is neither too low nor too high. The current approach to setting interest rates, including today’s decision, is based on two key judgements. Key policy judgement 1 The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. The recent experience of high inflation could still be affecting wages and prices. This could create more persistent inflationary pressure, requiring tighter monetary policy than otherwise. Services price inflation and wage growth still need to fall further for the MPC to be confident that inflation will return to the target and stay there (Box A: Estimates of ‘target-consistent’ wage growth). In addition, weak productivity growth could put upward pressure on companies’ costs (Box C: The outlook for productivity growth). However, other developments and new analysis suggest that the risk of greater inflation persistence has continued to diminish. The outlook for inflation over the next six months is notably lower than expected in November. That mainly reflects developments in energy prices, including the impact of measures announced in Budget 2025 (Box D: Budget 2025 and the impact of fiscal policy on the economy). Lower inflation in coming months should feed through into lower inflation expectations among households and businesses, reducing the risk that high inflation becomes self-fulfilling (Box B of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). And, while wage growth may only be falling slowly, new evidence provides reassurance that structural changes in wage-setting will not keep adding to inflationary pressures (Box B: Heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour among UK firms). While concerns about the upside risk from greater inflation persistence continue to become less pronounced, some risks to the outlook for inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. This could lead to a substantial margin of spare capacity, causing inflation to settle below the 2% target unless monetary policy were loosened further. Despite past reductions in Bank Rate, the household saving rate remains above historical levels. That could indicate that households are more cautious following the recent shocks to their finances, and that spending growth will remain weak (Box D of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Labour market conditions have loosened (Section 1.2) and any further weakening in labour demand could lead to a more pronounced rise in unemployment (Box E of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Key policy judgement 2 On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. Monetary policy is being set to ensure that inflation not only reaches the 2% target but remains sustainably at the target in the medium term. Monetary policy continues to weigh on inflation and activity (Box E: Monitoring the transmission of monetary policy with interest rate-sensitive indicators). If inflationary pressures continue to ease, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further reductions will become a closer call. As always, the extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. On the one hand, cutting Bank Rate too quickly or by too much could lead to inflationary pressures persisting, requiring policy to change course. On the other hand, waiting too long to ease policy could come at the cost of a sharper downturn in activity, and subsequently inflation, requiring greater policy easing later on to ensure inflation returns sustainably to the target. With uncertainty around how precisely a neutral level of Bank Rate can be estimated, slowing the pace of further easing could provide space to gain assurance about how the risks are evolving. The central projection described in Section 3.1 provides a reasonable baseline for how the majority of the MPC judges the economy is likely to evolve if neither of the remaining risks around inflation persistence and demand weakness materialise to a meaningful degree. Section 3.2 sets out how the economy could evolve differently to the central projection, including by updating the scenarios from the November Report. These scenarios also help the MPC to consider how well different monetary policy responses might perform in achieving the MPC’s objective of low and stable inflation at the 2% target. At this meeting, the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75%. More evidence is needed on how the risks to the medium-term outlook are evolving before cutting Bank Rate further. 1: Current economic conditions 1.1: Inflation Headline CPI inflation was 3.4% in December, slightly lower than expected at the time of the November Report. CPI inflation has fallen by 0.4 percentage points from its recent peak in September (Chart 1.1) and was 0.1 percentage points below expectations at the time of the November Report. The downside news relative to November largely reflects lower food and services price inflation. Despite the recent slowing, inflation remains above the 2% target. That in part reflects unusually large increases in administered prices such as Vehicle Excise Duty and higher water bills. These are currently estimated to be contributing around 0.5 percentage points to the inflation overshoot, based on the difference between their current and historical contributions (Chart 1.3). Food, beverage and tobacco inflation is estimated to be contributing a further 0.5 percentage points to the inflation overshoot. Elevated labour cost growth is also pushing up inflation, particularly for services which tend to be labour intensive. Chart 1.1: CPI inflation was 3.4% in December Contributions to CPI inflation ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Figures in parentheses are CPI basket weights in 2025, which do not sum to 100% due to rounding. Data are shown to December 2025. Component-level Bank staff projections are shown from January 2026 to June 2026. The projection also accounts for expected changes in CPI weights in 2026. The food component is defined as food and non-alcoholic beverages. Fuels and lubricants estimates use DESNZ petrol price data for January 2026 and are then projected based on the sterling oil futures curve. Headline CPI inflation is projected to slow much more than expected in the November Report, to 2.1% in 2026 Q2, largely reflecting measures announced in Budget 2025. CPI inflation is expected to fall to 2.1% in 2026 Q2, a 0.7 percentage point greater fall than anticipated in the November Report (Chart 1.2). That news largely reflects the energy bills package announced in Budget 2025 (Box D), which, alongside a fall in wholesale gas prices, is expected to result in a decline in the Ofgem price cap in April to £1,616 from £1,758. That fall in the contribution of utility prices represents around one third of the overall expected decline in CPI inflation in the first six months of 2026 (Chart 1.1). Chart 1.2: Lower household energy prices mean that CPI inflation is projected to slow much more than expected in the November Report News to CPI inflation relative to the November 2025 projection ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Bank staff’s short-term inflation forecast only extends for six months. For that reason the Q2 ‘Non-energy’ bar represents the difference between the February Report short-term forecast shown in Chart 1.1 and the November Report medium-term central projection, excluding the effects of energy. The ‘Energy due to Budget’ bars represent the estimated impact of the energy bills package and the extension of the fuel duty cut. The ‘Non-Budget energy’ bar represents expected falls in utility price inflation due to non-Budget related factors such as falls in wholesale gas prices. A reduction in the contribution from other changes in administered prices, regulated prices and indirect taxes (AR&T) is also expected to support the near-term disinflation process. Bank staff judge that the overall contribution of AR&T will fall to around its historical average in 2026 Q4 (Chart 1.3). Chart 1.3: The estimated contribution of AR&T to CPI inflation is expected to be around its historical average by 2026 Q4 Estimated contributions of AR&T to CPI inflation (excluding major VAT changes) ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) These data exclude major VAT changes in 2008–11 and 2020–22, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the Energy Price Guarantee effective 2022–24. The diamond includes the impact of the energy bills package announced in Budget 2025 which is worth a little over 0.2 percentage points. Around 12% of the basket is estimated to be associated with AR&T changes. Given the variability of the contribution of AR&T over the past, the long-term average might not be a good guide to future trends. The latest data are for December 2025 and the diamond is for 2026 Q4. A broad-based slowing in other components is expected to account for the remaining fall in CPI inflation over 2026 H1. That in part reflects the continued slowing in wage growth and a fading impulse from the 2025 increase in employer NICs. Continued falls in some indicators of external costs are also expected to support disinflation in the near term. Bank staff project that core goods inflation will fall to 0.9% by June 2026, slightly above its 2012–19 average. Services and food price inflation are expected to moderate to 3.3% and 2.4% respectively, close to, but still slightly above, their 2012–19 averages. Global price pressures remain subdued. Indicators of global price pressures have been weak, reflecting falling energy prices, domestic demand weakness in China and the effects of higher US tariffs. Chinese export prices fell by over 2% in the year to 2025 Q3, which may be partly due to trade diversion, as well as continuing demand weakness in China. This, alongside weakness in euro-area export prices and the US dollar, has meant that aggregate UK import prices have been fairly flat over 2025 and import price inflation is expected to remain subdued. Spot oil prices were around $66 a barrel in the 15 UK working days to 26 January, a little higher than in the period leading up to the November Report. The UK gas futures curve has fallen by around 13% on average over the same period. Indicators of food price inflation have eased. Agricultural commodity prices for items such as cocoa and cattle had surged in 2025 (Box E of the August 2025 Monetary Policy Report ), pushing up consumer prices, but these have since fallen from their recent peaks. Further down the supply chain, producer output prices have been flat since August. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that food price inflation has peaked and should moderate further from here ( Agents’ summary of business conditions – February 2026 (ASBC)). Wage growth has continued to moderate. Annual private sector regular AWE growth slowed to 3.6% in the three months to November, down from 4.4% in the three months to August and 0.1 percentage points below the projection in the November Report. That fall was partly due to mechanical base effects, as strong monthly growth rates from last year dropped out of the annual comparison, but timelier measures of pay growth have also cooled. Bank staff estimates that abstract from volatile movements in AWE indicate a three-month annualised growth rate of around 3¼%. Alternative indicators generally also suggest continuing moderation, though to differing degrees. An estimate of private sector median pay based on HMRC RTI data implies pay growth of 4.6% in December 2025, down from 5.0% in September 2025. The recent slowing in wage growth has brought it closer into line with the rate implied by its key determinants, following a period of unexplained strength. A model estimated on pre-Covid pandemic data suggests that the estimated rate of wage growth in 2025 Q4 can be largely explained by movements in inflation expectations, productivity and the margin of slack in the economy (Chart 1.4). Box B discusses reasons for the recent excess strength in wage growth shown in the gold bars and implications for the wage outlook. Chart 1.4: Wage growth is broadly as expected based on a simple model of its key determinants Contributions to estimated annual private sector regular pay growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Barclays, Citi/YouGov, ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Wage equation based on Yellen (2017) . Short-term inflation expectations are based on the Barclays Basix Index and the YouGov/Citigroup one-year ahead measure of household inflation expectations. Slack is based on the MPC’s estimate of the unemployment gap. Productivity growth is based on market sector productivity growth per head. Values may not sum due to rounding. The unexplained component is the residual. The final data point is 2025 Q3 and the estimate for 2025 Q4 is a staff projection. In contrast to the slowing in the private sector, public sector regular pay growth rose to 7.9% in the three months to November. That in part reflects some public sector pay rises being implemented earlier in 2025 than in 2024. The risk that high public sector pay growth spills over to the private sector is likely to be low, in part because job flows between the two sectors are currently below their pre-pandemic averages. Some further easing in wage growth is expected in 2026 as labour market conditions continue to loosen. The Agents’ pay survey suggests that basic private sector pay settlements will average 3.4% over 2026, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the November Report, and down from an average actual pay settlement of 4.0% in 2025 ( ASBC – February 2026 ). The distribution of expected pay settlements has shifted lower, with over 70% of settlements now in the 2%–4% range (Chart 1.5). Firms reported that current and expected inflation were the most important factors pushing up pay settlements. Firms’ ability to recruit and retain staff remained important, but less so than in 2025, consistent with the continued loosening in the labour market. Chart 1.5: The distribution of expected pay settlements in the Agents’ pay survey has shifted left Fitted kernel density and median survey expectations ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents and Bank calculations. ( a) Kernel density estimates of the distribution of one year ahead expected pay settlements from the Agents’ pay survey. Curves are smoothed representations of the underlying survey responses. Each line shows the distribution of responses for the year indicated. Dashed lines represent the median survey expectations for each year. The latest data are the 2026 expected pay settlements. Other forward-looking indicators of pay growth are also consistent with some further easing. Firms responding to the DMP Survey, for example, expect wage growth to fall by 0.7 percentage points to 3.7% by 2026 Q4, and then a little further in the three months to January 2027. A smaller increase in the NLW should help to support the disinflation process. The forthcoming increase in April 2026, of 4.1%, is expected to have a negligible impact on aggregate wage growth, in contrast to the 0.2 percentage points boost to wage growth estimated in 2025, when the NLW was increased by 6.7%. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that lower pressure from the NLW is expected to reduce labour cost growth this year. Bank staff’s central projection is for a further slowing in AWE growth, to 3.2% by 2026 Q2 (Chart 1.6). The projection is informed by the 3.4% estimate for basic settlements from the Agents’ pay survey, as well as an expectation that pay drift will weigh on AWE pay growth. Pay drift reflects the extent to which aggregate pay growth diverges from pay settlements and can be positive when firms are under pressure to raise pay to retain or attract workers. As the labour market has loosened (Section 1.2), pay drift has turned slightly negative. Firms’ average wage expectations in the DMP Survey could suggest upside risks to this projection, however. Chart 1.6: Wage growth has fallen and is expected to moderate somewhat further Measures of private sector wage growth and pay settlements ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents, Brightmine, CIPD, DMP Survey, Incomes Data Research, Labour Research Department, ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) AWE private sector regular pay shows the ONS measure of private sector regular AWE growth (three-month average on same three-month average a year ago). The DMP expected pay series is a three-month average, measuring pay growth for the year ahead. It measures total wage growth per worker. The other measures capture basic pay settlements which may differ from AWE growth due to pay drift. The latest AWE data are for the three months to November, while the aqua diamonds are quarterly projections for 2025 Q4–2026 Q2. The DMP expected pay growth is for the three months to December. The Agents’ pay survey diamond shows respondents’ expected average pay settlements in 2026, weighted by employment and sector. The Bank of England settlements database is a 12-month average to December 2025. The Brightmine and CIPD data are three-month averages to December 2025. Measures of underlying services inflation eased over 2025 as a whole but edged up slightly in the most recent data. Measures of underlying services inflation have eased over the past year, and monthly annualised inflation rates are currently at around 4% (Chart 1.7). These measures ticked up slightly in the most recent data, partly reflecting a pickup in restaurant and café prices which rose by an annualised rate of 5% on the quarter. In turn that is probably the consequence of lagged pass-through of last year’s rise in food price inflation, which is expected to moderate in the coming months. The decline in wage growth and a fading impact from higher employer NICs are expected to support a further easing in annual services inflation, to 3.3% by June 2026. That easing is expected to be broad-based, with the trimmed-mean measure of underlying services inflation (Chart 1.7, orange line) expected to fall to around 3 ½% over the next few months, leaving both measures slightly above the range that is likely to be consistent with CPI inflation at target. There is a risk that pass-through from lower wage growth to services inflation is more limited if firms seek to rebuild their margins over and above their costs (Box A of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). 39% of firms responding to the DMP Survey said they expected to rebuild margins in the year ahead. But contacts of the Bank’s Agents expect a limited degree of margins rebuild over the next year, mainly reflecting continuing weakness in demand ( ASBC – February 2026 ). Chart 1.7: Underlying services inflation measures have edged up slightly Measures of three-month average monthly annualised services price inflation ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Measures shown are three-month averages of seasonally adjusted monthly annualised inflation. The low-variance measure is calculated by weighting each component of services inflation by the inverse variance of the change in 12-month inflation of that component from 12 months previously. The maximum adjusted weight is capped at twice its original value. Details of the components that have been included/excluded from the Services excluding indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays measure are included in the accompanying spreadsheet published online. The trimmed-mean measure excludes the 10% largest and 10% smallest price changes. The latest data points are for December 2025. Inflation expectations Households’ and firms’ inflation expectations remain elevated. Short-term household inflation expectations remain above their long-term averages (Chart 1.8, aqua lines in left panel). The Citi one-year-ahead measure stood at 3.8% in January, down from 4.2% in October but around 2 standard deviations above its 2010–19 average. The equivalent measure from the Inflation Attitudes Survey fell by 0.1 percentage points to 3.5% in 2025 Q4 but is also above its historical average. Medium-term household measures remain elevated. Household inflation expectations are above the range implied by their past relationships with other economic variables. Short-term expectations tend to be sensitive to developments in spot consumer price inflation ( Rowe (2016) ), however. Consequently, as headline inflation falls in coming months, short-term inflation expectations are expected to moderate towards their pre-pandemic averages, although there are risks around this (Section 3.2 and Box B of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Firms’ inflation expectations also appear somewhat elevated. One-year-ahead CPI expectations of firms responding to the DMP Survey in the three months to January were 3.2% on average, down from 3.4% in the three months to October, while three-year-ahead expectations were unchanged at 2.9% (Chart 1.8, right panel). Firms’ average two-year-ahead CPI expectations in the Deloitte CFO Survey for 2025 Q4 were 2.5%, a little above their 2014–19 average of 2.2%. The own-price expectations of firms responding to the DMP Survey in the three months to January were 3.5% on average for the year ahead, compared with realised price growth of 3.7%, implying little disinflation over the coming year . But firms’ own price expectations tend to respond to realised inflation and so should fall back as CPI inflation falls in coming months. Medium-term inflation expectations implied by financial markets, such as the five-year, five-year forward inflation swap rate, have risen slightly since the November Report. The median respondent to the latest Market Participants Survey expected CPI inflation one year ahead to be 2.2%, a little lower than the 2.3% reported in the November Survey, and to be 2% at the three-year horizon. Chart 1.8: Households’ and firms’ inflation expectations have eased a little but remain elevated Survey-based measures of household ( a ) and business inflation expectations ( b ) Footnotes Sources: Citigroup, DMP Survey, YouGov and Bank calculations. ( a) Data shown are from the Citi/YouGov survey and are based on responses to the questions: ‘How do you expect consumer prices of goods and services will develop in the next 12 months?’, and ‘And what do you think will happen to the prices of goods and services, on average, over the longer term – say five to ten years?’. Dashed lines represent the series averages over 2010–19. The latest data points are for January 2026. ( b) Data shown are from the DMP Survey and are based on three-month averages of responses to the question: ‘What do you think the annual CPI inflation rate will be in the UK, one year from now and three years from now?’. The latest data points are for January 2026. The DMP Survey data have a short back-run, so no historical averages are shown. 1.2: Activity Domestic demand Underlying GDP growth remains subdued, consistent with weak growth in potential supply and a small drag from past monetary tightening and uncertainty. Underlying GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.1% in 2025 Q4, down from 0.2% in Q3 and slightly lower than headline GDP growth (Chart 1.9). These growth rates are a little lower than estimated potential supply growth, although that has also been subdued in recent quarters. Market sector output growth has been even weaker than underlying growth over the past 18 months, as past monetary policy restrictiveness and uncertainty, in part relating to Budget 2025, have weighted on activity (Chart 1.10). Public sector output growth has been stronger and is expected to remain robust. Chart 1.9: Underlying GDP growth remains subdued, but is expected to pick up slightly Quarterly growth in headline GDP and underlying growth implied by business surveys ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents, BCC, CBI, Lloyds Business Barometer, ONS, S&P Global and Bank calculations. (a) The final data point for quarterly headline GDP growth is for 2025 Q3. The diamonds for 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q1 show Bank staff projections. Underlying GDP growth estimates are from a survey indicator model based on a Staggered-Combination MIDAS approach ( Moreira (2025) ). The orange diamonds to 2025 Q3 show in-sample fitted values of the survey indicator model, and diamonds for 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q1 show out-of-sample projections. The orange swathe shows the interquartile range of estimates from individual survey indicators in the model and values have been interpolated between quarters. Underlying growth is expected to pick up slightly in 2026 Q1, to 0.2%. This is broadly consistent with the S&P Global Composite UK PMI output index, which picked up in January to around its historical average. Agents’ contacts continue to expect subdued growth throughout 2026, citing weak confidence and subdued global demand ( ASBC – February 2026 ). Chart 1.10: Weakness in market sector output growth has been offset by strong growth in public sector output Changes in sectoral GDP since December 2023 ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Public sector output includes public administration and defence, education, and human health and social work activities. Market sector output is total GDP excluding public sector output. The final data points are for November 2025. Household consumption growth has been subdued but picked up in 2025 Q3. Past rises in interest rates have been a major driver of weak consumption growth in recent years, although Bank staff judge that these effects may be starting to wane (Box E). The household saving ratio fell to 9.7% in 2025 Q3 (Chart 1.11), reflecting lower real income growth and a pickup in consumption growth. Initial estimates of the household saving ratio are often subject to substantial revision, however. Despite the most recent fall, the saving ratio remains higher than in the decade prior to the pandemic. A large part of that is likely to reflect past monetary policy restrictiveness. Increases in the effective interest rate on the stock of UK mortgages are continuing to reduce household cash flows, for example, which is weighing on consumption. Past rises in inflation and heightened uncertainty could also be contributing to a higher saving ratio by causing a structural shift in households’ saving preferences (Box D of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). There continues to be little evidence that households are saving more for precautionary reasons, however. While evidence from the Bank of England/NMG survey points to higher economy-wide unemployment expectations, households’ own perceived job-loss risk remains low on average. And, whereas a pickup in flows of liquid deposits could signal that households are saving for precautionary reasons, the mix of liquid and illiquid deposits in households’ deposit flows has been similar to historical trends. Evidence from spending indicators suggests that consumption growth will remain weak in the near term. Retail sales volumes fell overall in 2025 Q4, and GfK consumer confidence remained subdued. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents expect weak consumer confidence to persist into early 2026. Real disposable incomes are expected to continue to rise, although the freeze in income tax thresholds will limit the support to household spending. While further increases in effective mortgage rates are expected to continue to weigh on spending growth, waning effects of past monetary policy restrictiveness are expected to boost consumption growth overall in coming quarters.

Business investment growth has been reasonably robust, although investment intentions have been weak. Business investment was revised up significantly as part of Blue Book 2025 and was relatively robust at 2.7% in the year to 2025 Q3 (Chart 1.12), driven by investment in information communications technology (ICT) and machinery. Recent business investment growth will have been supported by declines in firms’ external financing costs (Section 1.3). And contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that the cost of labour relative to capital has risen, raising incentives to invest in labour-saving technologies (Box C). As the lagged effects of past increases in interest rates continue to wane and some substitution from labour to capital continues, that is expected to support business investment growth in coming quarters. Subdued investment intentions could pose a downside risk to the near-term outlook for business investment growth, however. Investment intentions fell sharply in 2024 Q4 and have remained weak (Chart 1.2). Contacts of the Bank’s Agents note that the wider economic outlook is not conducive to investment ( ASBC – February 2026 ). And while some firms are resuming delayed investment projects, these are mainly intended to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

Labour market Underlying employment has been flat. Underlying employment growth has been around zero over the past year (Chart 1.13, left panel). That is weaker than subdued GDP growth would have implied, due to cost pressures from higher employer NICs and the NLW. The flash December HMRC payrolls data continue to point to weak hiring momentum, and survey evidence from the DMP and S&P Global Composite UK PMI suggests that employment growth remains subdued. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report headcount reductions in sectors most exposed to discretionary consumer spending and to the NLW and NICs increases. LFS employment growth rose slightly to 0.2% in the three months to November (Chart 1.13, left panel). Notwithstanding the latest uptick, recent outturns have brought the official measure more in line with the subdued growth implied by alternative indicators as LFS sample sizes have risen. Aggregate employment growth is expected to remain muted in the near term. Survey evidence from the DMP and S&P Global composite UK PMI continues to indicate subdued hiring intentions. Chart 1.13: Underlying employment has been flat and unemployment continues to rise Measures of underlying and LFS employment growth; unemployment rate and near-term projections ( a ) ( b ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents, DMP Survey, HMRC, KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs, Lloyds Business Barometer, ONS, S&P Global and Bank calculations. (a) Bank staff’s indicator-based measure of underlying employment growth is constructed using a dynamic factor model following the approach of Doz et al (2011) . The model extracts a common component from monthly survey indicators, capturing comovements across series. The common component is scaled to align with LFS employment growth between 2000–19. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval. The latest data are for January 2026 for the estimate of underlying employment based on survey data and for the three months to November 2025 for the LFS. (b) The latest data are for the three months to November 2025. The diamonds show Bank staff projections for the three months to December 2025 and March 2026 respectively. Although LFS unemployment data have been reinstated by the ONS, they are badged as official statistics in development and the LFS continues to suffer from low response rates, which can introduce volatility and potentially non-response bias (Box D of the May 2024 Monetary Policy Report ). Labour market conditions have loosened further… Consistent with continuing weakness in employment growth, the labour market appears to have loosened further. The unemployment rate remained at 5.1% in the three months to November (Chart 1.13, right panel) and measures of recruitment difficulties have eased. The LFS redundancy rate remains elevated relative to the last few months (Chart 1.14, orange line), although contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that firms have been managing headcount mainly through natural attrition rather than widespread redundancies ( ASBC – February 2026 ). Vacancy levels have stabilised since mid-2025, with a small pickup in the November data. But the rise in unemployment means that the vacancy to unemployment (V/U) ratio, one measure of labour market slack, has fallen further below its estimated equilibrium level. And net additional hours desired by workers as a proportion of average hours worked, a measure of under-employment, fell but remain elevated relative to their historical average (Chart 1.14, aqua line). The composition of the rise in unemployment is also consistent with labour market slack having increased. Bank staff analysis indicates that short-term unemployment has accounted for nearly half of the recent increase in LFS unemployment since its trough in 2022 Q3. Short-term unemployed workers typically move back into work more quickly, so a greater share of short-term unemployment suggests a larger pool of workers that can be absorbed back into employment relatively easily. Consistent with that, Bank staff estimates suggest that the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate has increased only slightly, although there are risks around this (Section 3.2). …and some further loosening is expected in the near term. The unemployment rate is expected to rise further to 5.3% by mid-2026, a little higher than the central expectation in the November Report. That is consistent with the latest uptick in forward-looking indicators for redundancies, such as HR1 notifications and Google searches for redundancies. The margin of slack in the economy is judged to have widened slightly further as demand growth has remained subdued. Consistent with the rise in labour market slack, recent evidence points to a gradual widening in aggregate spare capacity. Survey evidence on capacity utilisation and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts suggests that spare capacity within firms has increased further in recent months. And model-based estimates suggest that the economy-wide output gap has widened modestly (Section 3.2).

The aqua line is the number of net additional desired hours that the currently employed report they would like to work, on average, per week, expressed as a share of average weekly hours. Latest data are to 2025 Q3. 1.3: Global and financial conditions Global economic activity Global activity has been more resilient than expected. Bank staff estimate that the global effective tariff rate on imports into the US is around 17%, 1 percentage point lower than at the time of the November Report. The estimated effective US tariff rate on imports from the UK remains around 9%. Uncertainty over US trade policy has persisted (Section 3.2). Global activity has been more resilient than expected at the time of the November Report. Bank staff judge that uncertainty associated with past trade policy measures has been smaller than previously assumed. Easier global financial conditions have also supported global activity, while AI-related investment has boosted activity growth in some regions. UK-weighted world GDP growth is expected to have been 0.4% in 2025 Q4 (Chart 1.15) and is projected to pick up a little over the coming quarters as the expected drag from the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty is offset by a boost from global financial conditions.

(a) The diamonds show Bank staff projections for UK-weighted world quarterly GDP growth, and for quarterly GDP growth in China, the US and the euro area. The projections are for 2025 Q4 to 2026 Q2 for all of the areas. The preliminary flash estimate for 2025 Q4 euro-area GDP was published after the cut-off for incorporation into the forecast so the data point for that quarter is a projection. UK-weighted world GDP growth is constructed using real GDP growth rates of 188 countries weighted according to their shares in UK exports. Financial conditions The market-implied path for Bank Rate was a little lower relative to the lead up to the November Report. Based on the 15-day average of forward interest rates to 26 January, the market curve implied that Bank Rate would fall to around 3.3% in 2026 H2 (Chart 1.16). The market curve slopes upwards beyond 2026 and reaches 3.7% in early 2029. The median respondent to the Market Participants Survey expected Bank Rate to fall to 3.25% and stay there. The market-implied paths for US and euro-area policy rates were around 20 basis points higher, on average, over the next three years than in the period leading up to the November Report.

The November 2025 curves are estimated based on the 15 UK working days to 28 October 2025. The federal funds rate is the upper bound of the announced target range. The market-implied path for US policy rates is the expected effective federal funds rate. The ECB deposit rate is based on the date from which changes in policy rates are effective. The final data points are forward rates for March 2029. Overall financial conditions have eased slightly since the November Report. A financial conditions index constructed by Bank staff suggests that conditions have eased slightly compared with those at the time of the November Report. The sterling ERI appreciated somewhat in the run-up to the February Report. Sterling rose by nearly 1% against the US dollar and around 0.3% against the euro. UK and global equities have generally risen despite volatility linked to global technology company valuations and geopolitical developments. Since the November Report, 10-year UK government bond yields have fallen a little and are below the peaks observed last year. Recent Bank staff analysis indicates that much of the rise in long-term yields over 2025 was driven by higher term premia. That in turn reflected global geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about fiscal sustainability, with UK-specific evolving gilt-market demand dynamics also having played a role. Domestic credit conditions Lending rates have generally fallen following the reductions in Bank Rate and earlier falls in term reference rates, which will support borrowing volumes. Since their peaks, falls in Bank Rate and term OIS rates have generally passed through to the rates faced by households and corporates in line with historical experience. Rates on new corporate loans have fallen from their peaks, broadly tracking changes in Bank Rate (Chart 1.17, right panel). Mortgage rates have declined further since the November Report, with some products now at their lowest levels for several years (left panel). Quoted personal loan rates have eased slightly, while credit card rates remain close to recent highs, consistent with their historically slower adjustment and an unwind in spreads which had narrowed during the tightening phase. Pass-through to sight deposits remains low and gradual. Bank lending volumes have continued to pick up, supported by lower lending rates and improved credit supply. Net lending growth to households has continued to increase since November, across both secured lending and consumer credit, although real lending growth remains slightly below its pre-pandemic average. Bank lending to corporates has strengthened, particularly among large firms. And credit availability for both households and corporates has improved over the past year, according to responses to the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey – 2025 Q4 (CCS). For secured lending, this is consistent with a variety of developments including lenders’ responses to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) statement on mortgage stress rates in March and the FPC’s update to its Loan to Income (LTI) flow limit Recommendation in 2025 Q2. More generally, the FPC’s decision to lower the system-wide benchmark for Tier 1 capital should provide banks with greater confidence in using their existing capital to support lending. As the main source of money creation, the recovery in net lending has supported growth in broad money, which reached 5% in the year to December 2025. Stronger growth in money balances could signal upside risks for nominal spending and the inflation outlook, although that signal tends to be strongest over longer windows of time (Box D of the May 2025 Monetary Policy Report ).

The final business loan rate data are for December 2025. 2: Topical policy issues The boxes in this section highlight some of the key pieces of analysis that informed the MPC’s discussions. Box A: Estimates of ‘target-consistent’ wage growth Wage growth is an important determinant of inflationary pressures. But other determinants of inflation – including labour productivity, import prices and firms’ margins – will also influence whether inflation settles sustainably at target. This box describes an estimate of wage growth that, for plausible long-run growth rates of these other determinants, should be consistent with keeping inflation at 2%. It also provides a cross-check of that estimate based on historical correlations between wages and prices. The results suggest that target-consistent wage growth is likely to be around 3¼%, but there are risks in either direction. A higher estimate for target-consistent wage growth could mean that additional easing in monetary policy is required, while a lower estimate could mean that less easing is required, all else equal. What rate of wage growth would be consistent with meeting the 2% inflation target? Wage growth is an important determinant of inflation, with labour costs making up around two-fifths of consumer prices. But other determinants, including productivity growth, import prices and margins, will also affect inflationary pressures. These can be interlinked, for example higher productivity growth will ultimately feed through to wages, although that adjustment can take time. And inflation outturns can influence inflation expectations and subsequently wage growth. Looking at how the main determinants of inflation are likely to behave in the long run can help assess the rate of wage growth that would keep inflation sustainably at the target. These determinants fit into a simple formula that breaks inflation into imported costs and domestically generated pressures: CPI inflation reflects changes in the prices of imports as well as of domestically produced goods and services, with a lower rate of import price inflation meaning that the prices of domestic goods and services can grow at a faster rate while keeping inflation at target. Domestically generated inflation largely depends on how fast labour costs are growing relative to productivity (known as unit labour costs). And while firms tend to pass on wage costs directly to prices, pass-through is not always one-for-one and so domestically generated inflation also depends on how margins, the share of profits in total revenue, change over time. Assumptions about how each of these other determinants of inflation will grow in the long run implies an estimate for target-consistent wage growth of around 3¼% (Table A.A). Underlying this, long-run import price growth is assumed to be 1%, a little above its average since the late 1990s. Combined with an import share of 25%, based on ONS estimates , this implies that domestically generated inflation would need to be around 2¼% to be consistent with the inflation target. Within that, margins are assumed to be constant in the long run, consistent with a stable long-run profit share. And long-run labour productivity growth is assumed to be around 1% (Box C). Table A.A: Key assumptions underpinning Bank staff’s long-run estimate of target-consistent wage growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Import intensity data are not readily available on a historical basis, but a simple calculation based on the import share of GDP suggests that the import share was probably lower in the past. The import share of GDP has risen from around 20% in 1998 to around 24% in 2025. This analysis does not assume that the law of one price holds, so other than import prices, no other foreign price directly influences domestic prices. For simplicity, in the long run, capital costs are assumed to grow in line with labour costs, therefore the labour share of income and margins are assumed to be stable over time. Labour productivity refers to measured productivity per worker. Other factors such as taxes may also be important, but in the long run these are assumed to be immaterial. There is uncertainty around each of the assumptions contained in Table A.A, and some of these determinants may evolve differently over the next three years. This would mean that the rate of wage growth that is consistent with the 2% target could be higher or lower than 3¼%. One possibility is that something other than identified supply shocks such as the global financial crisis and Brexit has been weighing on productivity growth over the past two decades, and that this persists such that productivity growth remains below 1% (Box C). This could occur alongside structurally higher imported inflation due to rising global trade fragmentation and geopolitical tensions ( Dhingra (2025) ). To the extent that trade openness is associated with higher productivity, these factors could interact, such that a less open economy results in weaker productivity growth. These developments would raise inflation and require wage growth to fall further to be consistent with inflation at target, all else equal limiting the extent to which monetary policy might be eased further. In another state of the world, potential productivity growth could recover faster than anticipated, for example due to rising AI adoption (Box C). While that should be matched in the long term by stronger demand, and hence wages, that adjustment will not happen immediately. If this also occurred alongside persistent weakness in imported inflation due to subdued global demand and trade diversion (Section 3.2), that could mean wage growth would need to settle at a higher rate to be consistent with inflation remaining sustainably at target. That could support additional easing in monetary policy. What do empirical estimates imply for target-consistent wage growth? Another way to estimate target-consistent wage growth is to look at which rates of wage growth have been consistent with CPI inflation at 2% in the past. It can be difficult to find a clear and stable link between wages and inflation because of the varying contribution to CPI of energy, import prices and other external costs. Bank staff have therefore estimated the historical relationship between wages and CPI excluding energy and CPI services, while separately accounting for drivers of external costs and productivity. This empirical approach suggests that target-consistent wage growth is around 3.1%–3.2%, with an interquartile range of 2.9% to 3.4% (Chart A.1). That is broadly consistent with the estimate presented in Table A.A, although the uncertainty around the empirical estimate shown in Chart A.1 is very large. Chart A.1: There is a large degree of uncertainty around empirical estimates of target-consistent wage growth Fitted kernel density ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) The chart shows a kernel density of around 280 reduced‑form estimates derived from regressions linking labour costs to CPI inflation excluding energy and to CPI services. Each estimate corresponds to the implied wage growth consistent with 2% inflation, conditional on import price growth of 1%. The various specifications result from modelling both CPI excluding energy and CPI services using different measures of labour costs, such as AWE pay growth and unit labour costs, as well as a mixture of autoregressive distributed lag and error correction models. The models are mostly estimated over 1988–2025. Box B: Heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour among UK firms One possible explanation for the recent strength in wage growth is a structural change in wage-setting behaviour. A machine-learning approach, which identifies heterogeneity in wage-setting across firms and over time, finds little evidence for this hypothesis. Some of the recent unusual strength in wage growth can instead be explained by the lagged response to labour market conditions of firms whose wage-setting resembles collective bargaining behaviour. This type of wage-setting behaviour appears to be much more prevalent than implied by official data on the share of workers covered by collective wage agreements. Given the recent fall in inflation and continued loosening in the labour market, wage inflation among this type of firm is likely to slow in due course, all else equal allowing for a looser monetary policy stance. How do UK firms set wages? At a macroeconomic level, the key drivers of wage growth are productivity growth, inflation and inflation expectations, and labour market tightness. Many of these drivers are captured in standard models of pay growth including the Yellen (2017) equation (Section 1.1). Statutory policies such as the National Living Wage (NLW) can also affect pay growth. But wage-setting practices vary substantially across firms. According to intelligence from the Bank’s Agents, some firms respond strongly to specific labour market conditions in their sectors and regions, while others are mainly affected by national developments including changes in the NLW. Firms also differ in the degree to which collective bargaining agreements are in place, and in the extent to which they make use of performance-related pay. Explicitly accounting for heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour can help to improve our understanding of the determinants of wage growth. For example, some firms tend to adjust wages more quickly than others in response to changes in inflation. When the economy is relatively stable, a model that assumes the same lag between underlying determinants and wages across all firms may account for the evolution of wages reasonably well. But when there are large shocks, differences in how firms respond to underlying drivers may become more important in explaining aggregate wage dynamics. To explore the heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour across UK firms, Bank staff are developing a new machine-learning model, following an approach similar in spirit to Gregory et al (2025) . This analysis is based on the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which contains detailed information on employer and employee characteristics, hours and pay for over 1.3 million workers employed by 190,000 private sector firms starting in 2004. Bank staff have analysed this dataset using a clustering algorithm, which sorts data into groups by minimising the within-group variation and maximising the between-group variation. The algorithm considers a wide range of firm-level data to identify distinct types of wage-setting behaviour among UK firms. Results based on this modelling approach suggest that firms in the UK fall into four main categories of wage-setting behaviour. Drawing on intelligence from the Bank’s Agents, these four clusters can be interpreted as ‘reputational employers’ and ‘incentive payers’, each accounting for around 10% of private sector workers, and ‘cost minimisers’ and ‘bargaining employers’, each employing around 40% of the private sector workforce. The identified wage-setting clusters differ with respect to some key characteristics. Reputational employers offer higher pay than firms in other clusters, even after controlling for workers’ qualifications and experience. This may be both a recruitment and retention strategy to deal with skill shortages and to bolster their overall reputation. Reputational employers tend to raise wages quickly when inflation expectations increase. This type of wage-setting behaviour is common in the financial and IT sectors (Chart B.1). Incentive payers rely on performance bonuses more than firms in other clusters, and their wage-setting decisions are particularly sensitive to their own staff turnover. Firms in the agricultural and mining sectors are somewhat more likely to follow this model than firms in other sectors (Chart B.1). Cost minimisers employ a large share of workers at or close to the NLW. They tend to set wages partly in relation to changes in the NLW and partly based on labour market tightness in their industries and regions. Many firms in the accommodation and hospitality sector fall into this wage-setting cluster (Chart B.1). Bargaining firms may use collective agreements to set pay. However, this cluster also includes many firms that show bargaining-like behaviour without having formal collective agreements in place. The bargaining firms identified by the machine-learning analysis employ almost 40% of UK workers, which is significantly higher than official estimates of the share of private sector employees covered by explicit collective agreements (around 15%). Pay dispersion within these firms is relatively low, and wage growth tends to respond to both inflation and labour market conditions with longer lags than in other clusters. Bargaining firms are most common in industries with high shares of public sector employment, such as education, health, utilities and transport (Chart B.1).

(a) This work was undertaken in the ONS Secure Research Service using data from ONS and other owners and does not imply the endorsement of the ONS or other data owners. The clusters are identified using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm (K-means clustering), which groups the firm-level observations to minimise the differences within the clusters and maximise the differences between clusters. The chart shows the percentage of workers in each cluster by sector. Is there evidence for structural change in how UK firms set wages? Based on the specific machine-learning model developed by Bank staff, there is little evidence for structural change in the characteristics or size of wage-setting clusters in the UK economy. Reclustering the data over subperiods from 2004–09, 2010–19 and 2021–25 finds that the four distinct groups of wage-setters have been broadly stable (Chart B.2). This suggests that the pandemic and the subsequent period of high inflation have not induced many UK firms to fundamentally change their approach to wage-setting, and that the identified clusters tend to reflect approaches to wage-setting that do not vary materially across the business cycle. However, because the analysis focuses on identifying differences between employers, this finding cannot rule out potential economy-wide changes in wage-setting that could impact all clusters equally.

(a) This work was undertaken in the ONS Secure Research Service using data from ONS and other owners and does not imply the endorsement of the ONS or other data owners. Can accounting for heterogeneity help explain persistence in wage growth? Aggregate wage growth has been higher than the Bank’s standard macroeconomic models can account for in recent years ( Forecast Evaluation Report – January 2026 ). For example, the aggregate Yellen equation that accounts for wage growth based on measures of productivity growth, inflation expectations and labour-market slack showed material unexplained bars for most of the 2023–25 period (Chart 1.4). Aggregate models may not have revealed the full extent of persistence, however, as the correct lag structure is difficult to identify in the absence of a sufficient number of large shocks. Heterogeneous approaches tend to capture such relationships better by drawing on more granular data and allowing for different dynamics for separate groups. Across all four identified wage-setting clusters, wage growth has been high since 2022 (Chart B.3). In the most recent available ASHE data from April 2025, wage growth has fallen back significantly for reputational firms (aqua line) and incentive payers (gold line). But it remains elevated for cost minimisers (purple line) and bargaining employers (orange line). For the former, that can at least partly be explained by cost minimisers’ large exposure to the NLW, which has increased materially in recent years. For the latter, it probably reflects longer lags in bargaining employers’ responses to macroeconomic conditions in the face of large shocks. Accounting for heterogeneity by estimating separate Yellen equations for the four clusters and recombining into an aggregate wage equation can explain a greater proportion of wage growth. This is mainly due to accounting for a higher degree of bargaining behaviour in the economy and allowing the wage growth of these bargaining-type employers to react to all variables with a one-year lag, in contrast to the contemporaneous relationships estimated in the annual data for all other clusters. While the disaggregated data are only available at an annual frequency, this approach could plausibly reduce the degree of unexplained wage growth between 2023 and 2025 in Chart 1.4 by about a third. Given the continuing disinflation process and the recent loosening in the labour market, wage growth among bargaining firms is likely to slow. This would be consistent with evidence from the DMP Survey, which suggests that sectors with a relatively higher presence of bargaining firms do not have elevated year-ahead wage growth expectations compared with other sectors. Lower wage growth among bargaining firms should subsequently feed through to lower inflationary pressures. Chart B.3: Wage growth has fallen back more slowly in the bargaining and cost minimising clusters Median annual pay growth across wage-setting clusters ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ASHE and Bank calculations. (a) This work was undertaken in the ONS Secure Research Service using data from ONS and other owners and does not imply the endorsement of the ONS or other data owners. The chart shows median annual growth of regular pay for workers in each cluster. The final data points are for April 2025. Box C: The outlook for productivity growth Potential output growth matters for monetary policy because it affects the speed at which the economy can grow without generating excess inflationary pressures. A key determinant of potential output is the evolution of potential productivity. While measured productivity has been exceptionally weak in recent years, adjusting for possible mismeasurement and cyclicality suggests that potential productivity has been somewhat stronger. Potential productivity growth is projected to pick up to a little below its assumed long-run trend rate of 1% over the forecast period, but there are risks in both directions. Stronger productivity growth, for example due to larger-than-expected benefits from AI, could put temporary downward pressure on firms’ unit labour costs and require a looser policy stance, all else equal, while weaker productivity growth could require a tighter stance. How has productivity growth evolved over recent years? Measured productivity growth has been exceptionally weak on average since 2023. Gross value added per hour worked fell by 0.7% overall between 2022 Q4 and 2025 Q3, although that masks a more pronounced fall to 2024 Q3 and a subsequent pickup (Chart C.1, aqua line in left panel). Adjusting the official measure of productivity growth for erratic and volatile components of GDP and possible mismeasurement in LFS data suggests a flatter path for productivity growth over recent years. The orange line in the left panel of Chart C.1 adjusts headline productivity growth using Bank staff’s measure of underlying GDP (Chart 1.9). It also accounts for possible measurement error in LFS total hours worked , by combining Bank staff’s estimate of underlying employment growth (Chart 1.13) with an estimate of underlying hours worked, which better accounts for estimates of temporary and structural biases in existing measures. This indicator suggests a less pronounced slowdown in measured productivity growth over 2023–24 than in the official data. Part of the recent weakness in productivity also appears to have been cyclical. Bank staff’s central estimate of potential productivity growth, which is informed by a range of measures that account for capacity utilisation, suggests that potential productivity growth has been stronger over recent years than measured productivity growth (Chart C.1, purple line in left panel). Nevertheless, it has been subdued relative to its assumed long-run trend growth rate of 1%, averaging ½% per year since 2024. Chart C.1: Part of the weakness in measured productivity growth appears to have been cyclical; potential productivity growth is expected to pick up towards 1% per year over the forecast period Measures of annual productivity growth ( a ) and projected contributions to potential productivity growth ( b ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The measures of productivity shown are based on output per hour worked. The adjustments in the orange line are based on the indicator-based models from Charts 1.9 and 1.13 for underlying GDP and underlying employment, respectively. Hours worked are further adjusted for estimates of possible biases in LFS data that are used in official productivity measures, associated with the decline and subsequent recovery in response rates across different survey waves in recent years. The estimate of potential productivity growth is consistent with the central projection for potential output growth and is informed by a range of measures, such as filter models and an indicator that further adjusts the orange line for a measure of capacity utilisation constructed with a range of cyclical data across industries. The final data points are for 2025 Q3. (b) The decomposition of potential productivity growth is based on a growth-accounting framework using a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production function, with the elasticity of output with respect to capital set to one third. The contribution from total factor productivity is a residual. What is the outlook for potential productivity growth? Potential productivity growth is projected to pick up modestly over the forecast period to a little below its assumed long-run trend rate (Chart C.1, purple diamonds in right panel). That is broadly in line with the OBR’s latest assessment of productivity growth. Potential productivity growth can be split into contributions from capital deepening (the available capital services per worker) and total factor productivity (TFP). Growth in capital deepening (Chart C.1, gold bars in right panel) is expected to be supported by relatively robust business investment over the forecast period. That is consistent with further falls in monetary policy restrictiveness, as well as reports from contacts of the Bank’s Agents who have noted that they intend to respond to future rises in demand by investing in automation and AI, rather than by raising headcount ( ASBC – February 2026 ). In the central projection, the effects of Brexit are assumed to leave the level of potential productivity 3¼% lower than otherwise by end-2028 (Box E of the February 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Bank staff judge that this effect can explain almost all of the difference between the current estimated level of potential productivity and its assumed long-run trend level. The remaining effects of Brexit on potential productivity growth are expected to fade gradually over the forecast period, consistent with a modest pickup in TFP growth (Chart C.1, green bars in right panel). Nevertheless, potential productivity growth is projected to remain a little below its assumed long-run trend rate over that horizon (purple diamonds). A larger remaining drag from Brexit could mean that TFP growth remains weaker than expected over coming years. Recent empirical evidence suggests that Brexit may already have had a larger-than-expected impact on trade volumes, through disruption to trade in services ( Bhalotia et al (2025) ) as well as to trade in goods. It is possible that any additional knock-on effects on productivity growth will be slow to come through. It is also possible that the assumed 1% long-run trend rate of potential productivity growth is too high. That assumption is informed by long-run filter model estimates of productivity growth and was first described in the February 2019 Inflation Report following outturns for productivity growth that had been consistently weaker than expected over the previous decade. Measured productivity growth has averaged about ½% per year over the past two decades but is estimated to have been depressed relative to its long-run trend by various shocks including the 2008–09 global financial crisis, Brexit and the Covid pandemic. However, it is possible that estimates have overstated the degree to which slow growth in measured productivity has been due to those identified shocks rather than other factors, which could mean that the weakness in productivity growth persists. There are also upside risks to the productivity outlook, particularly if benefits from AI are larger than expected. While cross-country comparisons are difficult due to differences in data sources and survey questions, firm-level survey data suggest that UK businesses may be some of the biggest adopters of AI so far. And AI adoption may accelerate over coming years if it follows the pattern of previous technological innovations, where slower initial uptake has tended to be followed by a period of much quicker technological diffusion ( Rogers (1983) ). That said, the uptake of other technologies linked to AI, such as robotics, does not appear to have picked up much over recent years ( Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) ). There is a high degree of uncertainty around the possible impact of AI on productivity growth. The range of estimates focused on the US economy is wide (for example, Acemoglu (2024) , Aghion and Bunel (2024) and Filippucci et al (2024) ), although the literature generally points towards a positive impact on productivity over a long period. Respondents to the latest DMP Survey expected AI to increase their firms’ productivity by around 0.6% per year on average over the next three years. The MPC will continue to monitor the potential macroeconomic impacts of AI, including on employment and productivity. The strength of productivity growth has implications for firms’ unit labour costs and hence inflationary pressures. If productivity growth is lower than expected, that could put further upward pressure on firms’ unit labour costs, absent a full and fast adjustment in wages and demand (Box A). In turn that could require a tighter monetary policy stance, all else equal. The opposite would be true if productivity growth were to be higher than expected. What is the outlook for overall potential output growth? Although estimated potential productivity growth has averaged below its assumed long-run trend rate since 2024, that has been more than offset by strong population growth, and hence potential labour supply (Table C.A). Overall, growth in potential output is estimated to have exceeded growth in demand, such that a negative output gap has opened up (Section 1.2). Annual potential output growth is expected to be a little below its assumed long-run trend rate of 1.5% on average over the forecast period (Table C.A). A greater share of that growth than in recent years is expected to be accounted for by growth in potential productivity. Most of the remainder reflects continued strength in population growth. Potential labour force participation and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment are expected to be broadly unchanged over the forecast period (Box F of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ).

(a) The data are percentage growth rates. The data for period averages are compound annual averages from the first year to the last year in the range. (b) The data are percentage point contributions to potential output growth. The data for period averages are compound annual averages from the first year to the last year in the range. The contributions may not sum to potential output growth due to rounding. Box D: Budget 2025 and the impact of fiscal policy on the economy Measures announced in Budget 2025 are expected to weigh on inflation in the short term, reducing the risk of second-round effects from the most recent period of higher inflation. The Budget measures are also expected to boost demand slightly over the forecast period. But that effect is small relative to the overall planned fiscal consolidation, which is projected to weigh on the output gap. What will be the impact of the policy measures announced in Budget 2025 on inflation and demand? The Government set out its tax and spending plans in Budget 2025, published on 26 November 2025. The fiscal measures announced in the Budget have been incorporated into the central projection (Section 3.1). The combined effect of the announced measures directly reduces CPI inflation by 0.5 percentage points at its peak in 2026 Q2 (Chart D.1, green line in left panel), leaving CPI inflation close to the 2% target in that quarter (Section 1.1). Around half of that impact reflects the energy bills package, which takes effect from April 2026 and is expected to reduce the typical household gas and electricity bill by £134 (orange bars). The delay to the rise in fuel duty rates until September 2026 is projected to weigh on headline inflation by a further 0.2 percentage points in 2026 Q2 (purple bars). And the freeze in rail fares from March 2026, together with the slightly more generous allowance for Vehicle Excise Duty on electric cars, provides a small further drag on CPI inflation in the near term (gold and aqua bars). The faster near-term fall in inflation following the measures announced in the Budget has not changed the judgement on the scale of remaining second-round inflation effects in the central projection (Section 3.1). That is consistent with the most recent period of higher inflation having not been expected to lead to additional second-round effects in previous Reports. Nevertheless, the risk of greater inflation persistence is judged to have continued to diminish, in part due to the lower near-term outlook for inflation (Section 3.2). The negative effect on inflation of the measures announced in Budget 2025 is expected to unwind from 2027 Q2, pushing up CPI inflation by 0.1 percentage points, on average, between 2027 Q2 and 2029 Q1 (Chart D.1, green line in left panel). The introduction of mileage‑based charges for electric vehicles in 2028 Q2 is provisionally expected to raise inflation slightly in the final year of the forecast (aqua bars) but there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this estimate. The combined effect of the measures announced in Budget 2025 is expected to be expansionary over the MPC’s forecast period, raising the level of real GDP by 0.2% at its peak in the 2027–28 fiscal year (Chart D.1, white line in right panel). Beyond the three-year forecast horizon, new tax increases are projected to dominate (red bars), such that the combined effect of the measures is expected to weigh on real GDP (dashed white line). Chart D.1: The policies announced in Budget 2025 are expected to weigh directly on inflation in the near term and are slightly expansionary over the MPC’s forecast period Estimated marginal impacts of Budget 2025 on projections for CPI inflation ( a ) and the level of real GDP ( b ) Footnotes Sources: Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The orange bars in the left panel capture the estimated impact of the reduction in costs levied on household electricity and gas from April 2026. The purple bars capture the estimated impacts of the measures taken to stagger and delay the reversal of the temporary 5p cut to fuel duty until September 2026, and to cancel this year’s uprating of fuel duty by RPI. Bank staff have estimated the CPI impact of these measures over 2026 and 2027 and have used OBR estimates over the remainder of the forecast period. OBR estimates have been used over the entire forecast period for the other measures on the chart. (b) The estimated impacts of Budget 2025 measures on the level of real GDP are based on the OBR’s costings and Bank staff’s fiscal multiplier estimates. The estimates for 2029–30 onwards fall beyond the MPC’s forecast period and are shown as lighter coloured bars and a dashed line. How has public sector net borrowing evolved? The OBR expects public sector net borrowing over 2025–26 to be £21 billion higher than projected in its forecast at the time of Spring Statement 2025. That follows similar upward revisions in several years since the Covid pandemic. Those revisions have partly reflected the discretionary policy decisions made by the current and previous governments. But underlying revisions to the OBR’s forecast , in part due to economic conditions having evolved differently to expectations, have also played a role. For example, the OBR has made significant upward revisions to expected welfare spending since the pandemic, due to higher inflation and higher health-related caseloads. Underlying upward revisions to the OBR’s forecasts for tax receipts have been much smaller than for spending over this period. What impact will the overall planned fiscal consolidation have on the output gap? Government plans imply a significant fiscal consolidation over the next five years (Chart D.2, white line in left panel), such that the OBR forecasts public sector net borrowing will fall from 4.5% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 1.9% of GDP in 2030–31. That consolidation is expected to be largely delivered through higher taxation (gold, green and pink bars). In the MPC’s central projection, the fiscal stance weighs on the output gap by around one percentage point by the end of the three-year forecast period (Chart D.2, yellow line in right panel). But that projection is sensitive to the assumed impact of changes in taxation on demand. While top-down cross-checks of the fiscal stance broadly support the MPC’s central projection, some bottom-up estimates suggest that the impact of the fiscal consolidation may be larger. The cyclically adjusted primary balance, a top-down measure that adjusts the government’s budget (excluding interest) for the position of the economic cycle using an estimate of the output gap, suggests a similar impact on demand from fiscal policy to the yellow line in the right panel of Chart D.2. It is possible that the tax multiplier used by Bank staff to translate a given change in tax policy into an impact on real GDP is too low, however. The range of tax multiplier estimates in the empirical literature is wide, but the multiplier used in the central projection is towards the lower end of that range. Applying a larger tax multiplier would generate a wider output gap over the forecast period (peach line). The timing of the effects of tax changes on demand is also uncertain, with a range of estimates in the empirical literature. Tax increases weigh on demand indirectly by reducing disposable income, meaning that they may take longer to impact economic activity than an increase in government spending. Sensitivity analysis suggests that a more gradual reduction in demand from tax increases would imply a larger drag on the output gap from fiscal policy towards the end of the forecast period than in the central projection (Chart D.2, red line in right panel). Conversely, anticipation of future planned tax increases could result in a more front-loaded reduction in demand (azure line). Households may choose to reduce consumption today if they expect planned tax changes to reduce their real incomes. Chart D.2: Tax receipts are expected to increase significantly over coming years, reducing public sector net borrowing and weighing on the output gap OBR projections for cumulative changes in public sector net borrowing as a percentage of real GDP since 2024–25 ( a ) and estimates of the contribution of the fiscal stance to the level of the output gap ( b ) Footnotes Sources: OBR, ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The estimates are based on the OBR’s November 2025 forecast. Other government spending includes OBR forecasts for government investment (capital departmental expenditure limit) and government consumption (resource departmental expenditure limit). Other taxes include OBR forecasts for VAT, corporation tax and property taxes. Negative values indicate a fall in expected public sector net borrowing. The estimates for 2029–30 onwards fall beyond the MPC’s forecast period. (b) After each fiscal event, Bank staff estimate the effects of discretionary policy changes on the level of real GDP by applying separate demand multipliers to changes in tax and different types of spending from their implementation dates. These effects are then converted into changes in the output gap by using an impulse response function that accounts for endogenous supply effects from changes in demand, for example through capital deepening. In the peach line, the tax multiplier is assumed to be double that in the central projection. The azure line assumes that discretionary changes in taxes have effects prior to their implementation. To illustrate those effects, in the azure line Bank staff assume that 20% of the impact of a change in taxes occurs up to four years prior to implementation and builds to its maximum estimated impact in the year of implementation. In the red line, tax increases are expected to take longer to impact demand but are scaled to have the same peak effect as in the central projection. The estimates for 2029–30 onwards fall beyond the MPC’s forecast period. Box E: Monitoring the transmission of monetary policy with interest rate-sensitive indicators Restrictive monetary policy has contributed to the disinflation process in recent years. But as Bank Rate has been gradually reduced, a key question is the extent to which interest rates are still weighing on activity and inflation. Tentative evidence from indicators of consumption, business investment and prices that are particularly sensitive to interest rates suggests that lagged effects of past monetary policy tightness continue to weigh on activity and inflation, but that those effects are gradually fading. Further policy easing will in part depend on the speed at which remaining inflationary pressures are expected to dissipate. How can we assess the impact of monetary policy on the economy? Tighter monetary policy reduces activity and inflation through a range of channels ( Burr and Willems (2024) ). One way of identifying the impact of changes in Bank Rate is to compare the evolution of more and less interest rate-sensitive components of demand and inflation. A fall in more interest rate-sensitive relative to less interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption, for example, could suggest that the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness is increasing. Bank staff monitor a range of indicators that are more sensitive to changes in monetary policy than aggregate measures of demand and inflation. To estimate interest rate sensitivities, staff have run local projections ( Jordà (2005) ) of various subcomponents of economic activity on the UK monetary policy shocks identified in Braun et al (2025) . These projections, together with DMP Survey responses on the adjustment of sales and investment to a rise in interest rates across sectors, have been used to classify subcomponents based on the strength and speed of their estimated response to monetary policy. The subcomponents have then been recombined into more and less interest rate-sensitive measures of consumption, investment and inflation. A comparison of more and less interest rate-sensitive components of activity and inflation can only be suggestive of monetary policy effects, however. A wide variety of shocks and confounders could pollute these measures if they happen to affect more interest rate-sensitive and less interest-rate sensitive components differently. In addition, the approach will not fully capture general equilibrium effects of monetary policy on demand, for example through the labour market. These will tend to affect both more and less interest rate-sensitive components and come through with long lags, which makes them harder to discern. The indicators presented in this box can therefore only provide tentative evidence of the extent to which monetary policy is weighing on demand and inflation. What can we learn from the evolution of more and less interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption and investment? Bank staff have identified subcomponents accounting for around 40% of household consumption and around 50% of investment as particularly sensitive to monetary policy. A significant part of the components classified as interest rate-sensitive consumption are durable goods that are frequently purchased with credit. Meanwhile, investment tends to be more sensitive for firms that operate with higher leverage. Interest rate-sensitive components of consumption have, on average, grown at a materially slower pace than implied by their pre-Covid pandemic trend in recent years (Chart E.1, orange lines in left panel). Interest rate-sensitive consumption was particularly weak in 2023, following material rises in Bank Rate from December 2021. Since the beginning of 2024, interest rate-sensitive consumption has increased again, though at a pace that is slightly weaker than the 2010–19 average growth rate. By contrast, less interest-rate sensitive parts of consumption have fallen only a little below their trend since 2021 (aqua lines). That would be consistent with monetary policy having had a more limited effect on this component of consumption. Chart E.1: High interest rates still appear to be weighing on more interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption and investment Investment and consumption components that are more and less sensitive to interest rates ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Braun et al (2025) , ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The analysis is based on quarterly ONS consumer trends data at the COICOP class level and quarterly ONS industry level investment data. The dashed lines show a hypothetical trend based on 2010–19 average growth rates. The latest data are for 2025 Q3 for consumption and 2025 Q2 for investment. Subcomponents of investment that have historically been sensitive to interest rates have grown more slowly than less sensitive subcomponents since the beginning of the tightening cycle (Chart E.1, right panel). This may partly reflect the effects of tight monetary policy via a cost of capital channel, which tend to come through quickly. More recently, interest rate-sensitive investment has picked up, which could in part be due to the reductions in Bank Rate since the summer of 2024. Meanwhile, less interest rate-sensitive investment has been only slightly weaker than its pre-Covid trend in recent years. Other drivers of spending, such as elevated uncertainty following past inflationary episodes (Box D of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ), could also be contributing to the divergence between the more and less interest rate-sensitive components shown in Chart E.1. This type of precautionary behaviour is likely to affect durables consumption to a greater degree than non-durables. Nevertheless, the measures in Chart E.1 are consistent with monetary policy having weighed on the economy in recent years. But the gradual pickup in interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption and investment since 2024 could suggest that monetary policy restrictiveness has started to fade and its overall impact on the level of demand may now be around its peak. What can we learn from more and less interest rate-sensitive components of the CPI inflation basket? Higher interest rates tend to weigh more on some items in the CPI basket than others, consistent with differential exposures to the various channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. For example, the prices of durable and discretionary goods and services may be more responsive to monetary policy because consumers adjust their demand for them more strongly and more quickly in response to changes in interest rates. Broadly following the methodology of Arnaut and Bengali (2024) , local projections of individual CPI components on identified monetary policy shocks indicate that around 35% of the UK CPI basket can be categorised as particularly sensitive to monetary policy. This is comparable to estimates of policy sensitivity of the HICP basket in the euro area ( Allayioti et al (2024) ). Items that are classified as less sensitive to monetary policy include, for example, pharmaceutical products, while more sensitive CPI components include jewellery and watches. The analysis focuses on core inflation because energy and food prices are driven to a large extent by developments in international markets. Both the more and less interest rate-sensitive parts of the CPI basket made significant contributions to the elevated rates of core inflation in 2022 and 2023 (Chart E.2). From the summer of 2023, inflation in interest rate-sensitive components has fallen back. Their contribution to core inflation has been close to its historical average since the beginning of 2025, though there has been limited progress since. Meanwhile, inflation in less interest rate-sensitive components has also fallen back significantly but continues to make an elevated contribution to core inflation. Chart E.2: Inflation for CPI items that are sensitive to monetary policy has fallen and is close to its pre-Covid average Contributions to core inflation from more and less interest rate-sensitive CPI components ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Braun et al (2025) , ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Individual CPI components, at COICOP-4 (class) level, are split into more and less interest rate-sensitive components, broadly following Arnaut and Bengali (2024) and Allayioti et al (2024) . The dashed lines show the average contributions to core inflation over 2012–19. The latest data are for December 2025. The chart excludes components with a large share of administered and regulated prices. The analysis is consistent with monetary policy having contributed to the disinflation process by returning the inflation rate of interest rate-sensitive components of the CPI basket to its historical average. Much of the remaining strength in the inflation rates of less sensitive components is likely to reflect elevated wage growth. Despite their classification as less sensitive to interest rates, monetary policy can still affect these parts of the CPI basket through a range of channels including the labour market, although with long lags. The recent loosening in the labour market is expected to continue to reduce wage growth over the MPC’s forecast period. But if progress on disinflation in less interest rate-sensitive items continued to stall, additional restrictiveness could allow the inflation target to be reached more quickly by temporarily pushing the interest rate-sensitive contribution to CPI inflation below its historical average. The case for further policy easing thus depends in part on the speed at which remaining inflationary pressures are expected to dissipate. 3: Outlook and risks 3.1: Central projection The central projection is based on a staff proposal, which the majority of the MPC agrees is a reasonable baseline. It provides an important input into the MPC’s discussions and policy decision. This projection is, as always, uncertain and the key risks are set out in Section 3.2. Conditioning assumptions The February central projection, summarised in Table 3.A and detailed more fully in Annex 1, is conditioned on a range of assumptions (set out in the Report’s Projections Databank ). That includes a market-implied path for Bank Rate which falls to around 3¼% by the final quarter of 2026, before rising towards the end of the forecast period, and the Government’s fiscal plans as set out in Budget 2025. Table 3.A: Forecast summary ( a ) ( b ) Footnotes (a) Figures in parentheses show the corresponding central projections in the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report. (b) The numbers shown in this table are conditioned on the assumptions described in the Report’s Projections Databank . (c) Four-quarter inflation rate. (d) Four-quarter growth in real GDP.

Chart 3.1: CPI inflation is expected to return to the 2% target this year and remain around that rate in the medium term. GDP growth is projected to rise modestly in the medium term, while the unemployment rate is expected to peak later this year Annual CPI inflation, GDP growth and the unemployment rate ( a ) Footnotes (a) The fan charts depict the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth, the ILO definition of unemployment, and CPI inflation. The uncertainty parameters determining the width of the fan charts have been calibrated to match the historical forecast errors since 2004 and up to 2025 Q2 for each variable at different horizons but exclude errors during the pandemic given its exceptional nature. The fan charts are constructed so that outturns are expected to lie within each pair of lighter areas on 30 occasions, with outturns expected to lie within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. On the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions, outturns can fall outside the respective aqua, orange or purple areas of the fan chart, depicted by the grey background. For GDP growth, the distribution reflects uncertainty around past data revisions and future evolution, so that the mature estimate would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 out of 100 occasions. The Committee no longer uses the calibration of the fan chart skew to reflect judgements on the balance of risks to the central projection. Inflation CPI inflation was 3.4% in 2025 Q4. It is projected to return to around the 2% target in 2026 Q2 and to remain close to that level over the forecast period. The near-term projection for CPI inflation is significantly lower than in the November Report, largely reflecting lower energy prices including from Budget 2025 (Box D). Chart 3.2 illustrates the underlying determinants of CPI inflation in the MPC’s central projection over the medium term. The contributions shown in this chart are based on the standard relationships and assumptions used in the Bank’s forecast models, the direct effects of certain tax policy measures, and judgements to capture relevant factors that are missing from the standard modelling toolkit such as the MPC’s previous judgements on inflation persistence (Box F). This approach attributes changes in past and projected inflation to broad economic influences, such as economic slack, that may affect multiple components of inflation. The expected near-term fall in CPI inflation reflects a lower contribution from energy prices, reflecting the energy bills package introduced in the Budget and lower wholesale gas prices (Chart 3.2, orange bars and Section 1.1). The contributions from administered prices and the pass-through of NICs-related costs are also assumed to dissipate in 2026 Q2 (azure bars and Section 1.1). The contribution from import prices declines over the course of the year (aqua bars) in part due to the expected effects of trade diversion weighing on world export prices (Sections 1.1 and 3.2). In the medium term, these factors make little contribution to the deviation of inflation from the 2% target, although the introduction of mileage‑based charges for electric vehicles is provisionally expected to raise inflation slightly in the final year of the forecast (azure bars). Chart 3.2: Inflation is expected to slow sharply in 2026 Q2 and to be close to the target over the remainder of the forecast Percentage point deviation from the 2% inflation target ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) ‘Administered prices, NICs, and electric vehicle (EV) mileage charge’ includes the estimated direct effects of changes to Vehicle Excise Duty, bus fares, VAT on school fees, and water charges. The NICs component represents Bank staff’s allowance for the effects of the recent increase in employers NICs on CPI inflation. The EV mileage charge component relates to the mileage-based charge on electric vehicles announced in Budget 2025. The ‘Energy budget measures’ bars represent the estimated direct effects of the energy bills package and the extension of the fuel duty freeze. The ‘Import prices’ bars includes an MPC judgement on the price of tradables ( May 2024 Monetary Policy Report ) which has little effect on the profile beyond 2026. The ‘Other’ bars represent other deviations of inflation not attributable to the listed influences including the estimated effects of changes to tobacco and vaping products duties. The restrictive stance of monetary policy, both currently and over recent years, is helping to bring inflation back to target. This policy stance has contributed to the economy operating with a margin of spare capacity, which over time weighs on domestic inflationary pressures (Chart 3.2, green bars). Monetary policy is acting against second-round effects in wage- and price-setting related to the 2022 peak in inflation. To capture these effects, whereby elevated CPI inflation at that time contributed to higher inflation expectations and in turn higher wage growth and inflationary pressures, the MPC introduced a judgement that estimated the extent of these additional effects (Chart 3.2, purple bars), including an assumption that they would unwind more slowly than they emerged (Section 5.3 of the Forecast Evaluation Report – January 2026 ). Over the forecast period, the impact of restrictive monetary policy is projected to continue acting against the remaining second-round effects in price- and wage-setting, such that these effects fade and then dissipate by end-2027 (Chart 3.2, purple bars). The margin of slack widens a little further in the near term, which, together with a fall in inflation expectations alongside headline inflation, supports a normalisation in wage-setting. Wage growth is projected to be slightly above its fundamental drivers over much of the first half of the forecast, based on the expected outlook for productivity (Box C), short-term inflation expectations and economic slack (Chart 3.3). The wage growth projection takes some signal from the Agents’ pay survey, which points to wage growth a little above what these fundamentals would imply in 2026 (Section 1.1). Over the second half of the forecast, pay growth is projected to move broadly in line with fundamentals and averages a little under 3%. Wage growth is close to estimated target-consistent levels throughout the forecast (Box A). Chart 3.3: Wage growth continues to moderate over the forecast Projections for private sector regular average weekly earnings four-quarter growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., Citigroup, ONS, YouGov and Bank calculations. (a) The shaded area represents a range of projections from three statistical models of nominal private sector regular average weekly earnings growth, including a wage equation based on Yellen (2017) , a wage equation based on Haldane (2018) and a simple error-correction model based on productivity, inflation expectations and slack in the labour market as embodied in the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the estimated medium-term equilibrium rate. The projections are dynamic, multi-step ahead forecasts beginning at a point within the models’ estimation periods and are sensitive to data revisions, which can lead to changes in the range over the past as well as over the forecast period. Activity Four-quarter UK GDP growth is projected to strengthen over the forecast period, to around 1.9% by the final year of the forecast. This partly reflects the gradual easing of monetary policy restrictiveness to date, as well as the further easing implied by the market path for interest rates. The pickup in GDP growth is accounted for primarily by a recovery in annual household consumption growth to a little over 2% by the end of the forecast period. Underpinning this is an expected fall in the saving ratio from just under 10% in 2025 Q4 to around 7½%. Accommodative financial conditions and increasing support from the housing market are also expected to support activity over the forecast period. Housing investment is expected to grow relatively strongly in 2027 and 2028, in part reflecting a positive impact from planning reforms (Section 1 of the May 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Global growth has been resilient over 2025, and is expected to continue at a steady pace over the forecast. Supportive global financial conditions and a waning impact on growth from tariffs and trade policy uncertainty is expected to support demand for UK exports. These factors more than offset an increasing drag on demand from fiscal policy over the forecast (Box D). Government spending growth is nonetheless expected to increase somewhat before easing back in 2028. The degree of slack present in the economy, which is currently estimated to be around 1% of GDP, widens a little further over the course of 2026, before starting to narrow as GDP growth outpaces supply growth (Box C). A small margin of spare capacity is projected to remain at the end of the forecast period. Compared with the November Report, there is a slightly greater degree of spare capacity throughout the forecast period. This in part reflects a judgement to take a signal from recent weaker-than-expected readings on the labour market and on capacity utilisation. The labour market has continued to loosen as subdued growth in output has fed through to weaker labour demand (Section 1.2). The unemployment rate is projected to peak in the second half of 2026, at around 5¼%, before declining gradually. Unemployment remains above Bank staff’s assumed medium-term equilibrium rate by the end of the forecast period, though there is uncertainty surrounding this estimate (Section 3.2). 3.2: Risks and sensitivities This section explores the risks to the economic outlook, including the possibility that a higher or lower future path for Bank Rate may be required for inflation to remain at the 2% target sustainably. The section contains an updated assessment of the two scenarios included in the November 2025 Report and sensitivity analysis of the implications for inflation of risks around the current size of the output gap, with the related illustrative policy simulations set out in Annex 2. Risks around structural change in the economy There remains a risk that structural changes in the labour market will keep wage growth above target-consistent rates. Wage growth has continued to moderate over the past year and is expected to fall further as the labour market loosens and headline inflation falls (Section 1). But forward-looking wage indicators including the DMP and Agents’ pay surveys suggest wage growth could remain more elevated. There is a risk that recent years’ large supply shocks have led to lasting changes in wage and price-setting behaviour, resulting in increased real wage resistance and a higher medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate, also known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), which in the central projection is expected to be around 4¾% in three years. If the NAIRU is higher, wage growth may fall more slowly than expected in the central projection. Evidence from clustering analysis of the ways that firms set wages suggests that firms’ wage-setting behaviour has been little changed over recent years (Box B). The analysis also finds that the share of workers whose wages are set in a way that is consistent with collective bargaining-type behaviour appears to be around twice the share of workers who are members of a union. Incorporating this finding into models helps explain why wage growth has typically been higher than expected over recent years and suggests that there is less risk that there has been an unidentified structural change in the labour market. However, last year’s increase in employer NICs could have resulted in a reduction in effective labour supply (Box F of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). The flow of workers leaving payrolled employment has been relatively larger for sectors that are more exposed to the rise in NICs, consistent with a large negative impact on employment in the DMP Survey. There is also a risk that other factors may have led to structural changes in the labour market, including changes in the incidence of long-term sickness, changes in the National Living Wage and developments in public sector wages. The rate of wage growth that is consistent with inflation at target could be higher or lower depending on the outlook for productivity growth. The inflation target-consistent rate of wage growth depends on a range of factors including import price inflation, productivity growth and firms’ average margins (Box A). There is uncertainty around how these factors will evolve. In particular, there are risks in both directions around future productivity growth (Box C). On one side, new technology, particularly AI, could boost productivity growth as it is adopted by businesses. In that case, wages could rise more quickly without preventing inflation settling sustainably at the target. On the other side, it is possible that something other than previously identified supply shocks such as the global financial crisis and Brexit has been slowing productivity growth over the past two decades, and that this persists such that the longer-term trend in productivity growth remains weak. All else equal then, wages would need to rise more slowly for inflation to return to target sustainably. Risks from inflation expectations Elevated inflation expectations continue to pose a risk that inflationary pressures will remain more persistent, but as inflation is now expected to fall back to around the 2% target in coming months that risk may be receding. Inflation expectations have remained elevated recently (Section 1.1). And past evidence has highlighted the importance of elevated inflation expectations for wage and price-setting (Box B of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). A scenario in the November 2025 Report explored how past high inflation could continue to affect wage and price-setting in the medium term through inflation expectations. Bank staff have updated that scenario to incorporate data published since then and the new central projection. In this updated scenario, inflation settles above the 2% target under the latest market curve, as it did in the November Report (Annex 2). This is because inflation expectations have remained elevated and could be suggesting additional upward pressure on wages and prices. The projected fall in inflation in coming months should lead inflation expectations to fall back, which in turn should help lessen the risks highlighted in the scenario. Inflation expectations, particularly for households, tend to move in line with inflation outturns over time. This is particularly likely to be the case as the inflation rate of salient products such as energy and food are expected to fall. In addition, the lower near-term inflation outlook should reduce the risk of threshold effects in inflation dynamics (Box C of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Inflation returning to around the target may therefore lessen the risks incorporated in the scenario. Nonetheless, developments in inflation expectations are uncertain. Households’ and firms’ recent experience of high inflation may make them less responsive to falling inflation outturns than might be expected based on historical relationships. In this case inflation expectations could remain elevated, as they do in the scenario. As was the case in the November Report, the set of mechanical policy rules under this scenario generally suggests that Bank Rate would need to be somewhat higher than in the equivalent rules under the central projection (Annex 2). The specific response from those policy rules results from the need to manage a trade-off between persistently above-target inflation and excess spare capacity in the economy. As was the case in November, the MPC would be likely to need to implement an even more restrictive monetary policy response than suggested by these rules to prevent an extended period of above-target inflation. As outlined in Annex 2, each policy rule uses different macroeconomic indicators and weights, leading to a range of different implied future paths for Bank Rate. Risks from consumption and labour demand There is a risk that household consumption growth will be slower than anticipated. The household saving ratio fell by 0.7 percentage points in 2025 Q3, driven by a fall in real household disposable income while real consumption grew modestly. But the saving ratio nevertheless remains above previous averages (Section 1.2). There is a risk that households’ consumption and saving behaviour has changed such that the saving ratio remains elevated, which means consumption could contribute less to demand. The November 2025 Report explored one potential manifestation of this risk using a scenario calibrated to assume a higher level of household risk aversion, accounting for around one third of the rise in the household saving ratio since 2022. An updated version of this scenario incorporating data developments since November and the new central projection results in inflation falling swiftly and remaining below target throughout the next three years under the market path for interest rates (Annex 2). These results are similar to those shown in the November Report, with the saving ratio staying broadly constant over the next few years rather than declining steadily, consumption growth being slower than in the central projection and the output gap widening by more. The set of mechanical policy rules under this scenario, with the exception of the forward-looking first-difference rule, suggests that Bank Rate would need to be reduced from its current level (Annex 2). An overall looser stance than implied by the market curve would probably be required to prevent inflation falling persistently below target. There is a risk that labour demand will be weaker than anticipated and lead to higher unemployment. Labour demand has remained weak over recent quarters and there is a risk that unemployment continues to rise beyond the near-term peak currently expected. There are some indications that redundancies are rising (Section 1.2). Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggests that businesses have grown more cautious about new hiring. And the recent rise in unemployment has been concentrated among the youngest age groups. Employment downturns have historically tended to emerge first among younger cohorts, meaning that these developments could be signalling a greater-than-anticipated weakening in labour demand. Weaker-than-expected labour demand may have greater consequences for unemployment when the economy is operating on a flat section of the Beveridge curve, as is currently the case. This means that changes to labour demand will tend to be associated with larger movements in unemployment (Box E of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Furthermore, historically there have been relatively few periods in which unemployment has risen slowly. Instead, it tends to be the case that there are turning points where unemployment rises quickly. Risks around the current level of spare capacity There is uncertainty over the current level of spare capacity in the economy, which would mean current inflationary pressures are stronger or weaker than embodied in the central projection. Some of the risks highlighted above would be associated with a different amount of spare capacity in the economy than is currently estimated in the central projection. For example, if there have been structural changes in the labour market such that labour supply is lower than assumed, that would mean that there is less spare capacity in the labour market. In contrast, if potential productivity growth has already been faster as a result of AI technology, there may be more spare capacity in the economy. There is a range of signals on the level of the output gap from different macroeconomic indicators. Persistently high domestic inflationary pressure and wage growth could be consistent with there being little spare capacity in the economy, but measures of capacity utilisation within firms and rising unemployment suggest that there could be significant spare capacity. The left panel of Chart 3.4 shows model-based estimates of the current level of the output gap, as well as the output gap in the central projection which synthesises evidence from these models and bottom-up analysis. These models are consistent with current spare capacity in the economy being within a range of around 0.5 percentage points around the central projection of around 1% of potential GDP. The right panel of Chart 3.4 uses a sensitivity analysis drawing on the relationships underlying the Bank’s COMPASS model to illustrate how uncertainty about the output gap generates uncertainty about the medium-term inflation outlook. If there were 0.5 percentage points more or less spare capacity over the forecast period, then inflation would tend to be around 0.2 percentage points lower or higher each year, holding interest rates in line with the market path of interest rates. These sensitivities are calculated based on a simple change in the output gap and use the model’s Phillips curve estimate, rather than separately modelled changes in components of supply and demand. Nevertheless, the results are similar to alternative estimates based on such changes, for example if there were a different level of the NAIRU. Chart 3.4: The range of output gap estimates is consistent with differences in the inflation outlook Output gap estimates, per cent of potential GDP (left panel) and estimated sensitivity of future inflation to a persistent change in the output gap level (right panel) ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The production function filter is an unobserved components model which integrates a multivariate ﬁlter approach with a Cobb-Douglas production function, following Toth (2021) . The output gap filter is a dynamic factor model-based estimate of the common cyclical component of GDP (including select GDP expenditure components), labour market indicators, capacity utilisation, wage growth, and inflation, following Jarociński and Lenza (2018) . The dynamic factor model is a data driven model that is less reliant on economic assumptions; it is based on 13 cyclical indicators covering labour market tightness, capacity utilisation, wages and inflation. In the sensitivity with more spare capacity, mechanical policy rules generally suggest that Bank Rate would need to be reduced from its current level and by more so than in the central projection (Chart 3.5, left panel). This is because greater spare capacity also pushes down on inflation. In contrast, when there is less spare capacity, the policy rules generally suggest Bank Rate would be closer to the market curve used in the central projection, albeit slightly higher (Chart 3.5, right panel). This is because a higher path for Bank Rate would be required to dampen the inflationary pressures generated by the smaller degree of spare capacity. Chart 3.5: A greater degree of spare capacity would imply a lower path for Bank Rate, while a smaller degree of spare capacity would imply a slightly higher path for Bank Rate, based on mechanical policy rules Bank Rate levels implied by select monetary policy rules under the central projection and assuming alternative paths for the output gap ( a ) Footnotes Source: Bank of England. (a) Annex 2 provides additional detail on the definition of the policy rules shown here and the equivalent paths for the output gap and inflation. These should not be interpreted as a prescription for how policy is likely to evolve. Risks around the restrictiveness of the monetary policy stance The degree to which the current monetary policy stance is restrictive is uncertain. One way to assess whether the current level of Bank Rate is restrictive is to compare it to an estimate of the neutral rate. The neutral rate, or equilibrium real interest rate, can be defined as the time-varying real interest rate that, if the economy started from a position of no output gap and inflation at target, would sustain output at potential and inflation at target. Overall, the evidence suggests that current monetary policy remains somewhat restrictive but, as Bank Rate has been reduced over recent quarters towards the neutral rate, it is becoming harder to judge exactly the extent of restrictiveness where small numbers are involved. Meanwhile, past higher levels of Bank Rate are continuing to reduce demand in the economy because of lags in transmission (Section 3.1). Updated Bank staff models of the gap between Bank Rate and the neutral rate (Box A of the August 2025 Monetary Policy Report ) suggest that there is currently a small positive real interest rate gap, ranging from around 0–1 percentage point (Chart 3.6, aqua and orange bars). That accords broadly with evidence from macroeconomic indicators of the monetary policy transmission mechanism (Box E). Chart 3.6: Models generally suggest that the current stance of monetary policy remains restrictive, although this is uncertain Average real interest rate gaps in February 2026 ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England, Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey, Bank of England Market Participants Survey (MaPS), Bloomberg Finance L.P., Consensus Economics, Davis et al (2024) , DMP Survey, ONS, TradeWeb FTSE Gilt Closing Data and Bank calculations. (a) All measures of the real interest rate gap presented in this chart show the implied degree of monetary policy restrictiveness over a three-year horizon. The macroeconomic models range is produced using estimates from a dynamic semi-structural investment-saving curve model and one of the main models underlying the central projection in this Report ( Albuquerque et al (2025) ). The macrofinancial model range is estimated using the state-space model from Davis et al (2024) , with a 95% confidence interval applied around the central estimates of the neutral rate. The financial markets range uses estimates of the nominal neutral rate derived from five term-premia models: the benchmark and survey models in Malik and Meldrum (2016) , Vlieghe (2016) , Andreasen and Meldrum (2015) and Meldrum and Roberts-Sklar (2015) . These estimates are adjusted by average six-year to 10-year inflation expectations from half-year Consensus surveys to obtain real neutral rate estimates. The real policy rates in the financial markets ranges are calculated as the average instantaneous forward OIS curves over three-year horizons, deflated by annual Consensus survey inflation expectations over this period. These inflation expectations are linearly interpolated over the three-year horizon. The instantaneous forward OIS curves are estimated using the average paths for interest rates in the 15 UK working days to 26 January 2026, on which the baseline projections for the February Report are conditioned. The DMP range is based on the difference between DMP respondents’ nominal one year ahead Bank Rate expectation relative to their three-year ahead Bank Rate expectation (which is assumed to match their perception of the neutral rate), adjusted by their expectation for CPI inflation over the same periods. The range shows the 10th–90th percentile of perceptions and the data were collected between November 2025 and January 2026. Some alternative indicators suggest that monetary policy may no longer be restrictive. Financial market derived measures of the real interest rate gap, MaPS and the DMP Survey all provide a wide range of estimates of the real rate gap (Chart 3.6). These ranges are wide enough that it is possible that Bank Rate may be around neutral or slightly accommodative, although these results are sensitive to the definition of inflation expectations used, and financial market contacts generally consider the current level of Bank Rate to be restrictive. Global shocks Global risks remain elevated. One area of continued uncertainty has been around global trade policy. Bank staff analysis suggests that the impacts of past increases in US tariffs, and the associated trade policy uncertainty, on global GDP have so far been smaller than expected. There remains a risk that the US government raises some tariff rates further in the future. And there are risks that heightened trade policy uncertainty has larger effects on the UK and global economy, for example by depressing businesses’ investment and via financial markets. Longer-term impacts on global productivity growth from greater global trade restrictions may also be larger, for example through less efficient allocation of activity. There is also uncertainty over the extent to which trade policy changes are affecting global export prices and to what extent this is reflected in UK import prices. There is indicative evidence that US tariffs have led to slower growth in export prices among countries more exposed to the new tariffs, particularly China since March 2025 ( Garofalo and Prayer (2026) ). This could be consistent with these countries facing reduced demand for their exports. UK import prices moved broadly in line with global export prices over 2025. If tariffs continue to slow global export price growth, that could reduce inflationary pressure in the UK, although the magnitude of this effect remains uncertain. Geopolitical developments also continue to create substantial uncertainty around the outlook for energy prices. Optimism about AI technology has boosted financial markets in recent years. If the benefits of this technology are lower than expected, this could reduce UK GDP. New AI technologies have increased global GDP growth, with the US particularly affected. This has been through increased investment, and by raising financial market asset prices. If the productivity and commercial benefits of AI technology are smaller than expected, that is likely to result in lower global investment, reducing global GDP. As the UK is not a main exporter of AI-related equipment, the UK impact should be limited. The UK economy would be more exposed through the effect on equity prices. If US stock markets fall after a reassessment of the value of AI, that would be likely to spillover into a fall in UK equity prices, with potential knock-on effects on other financial assets. That would lower the value of assets held by UK households and businesses, reducing consumption and investment. Given the fact that AI investment has been financed predominantly through cash and equity to date, the FPC considers that that currently limits the likelihood of severe systemic risk implications from a market revaluation of the benefits of AI (Box C of the December 2025 Financial Stability Report ). In general, to the extent that tail risk type events do not significantly affect the current balance of risks in the economy, it is unlikely to be effective for monetary policy to respond pre-emptively, particularly if the probability or impact of the shock occurring is unaffected by the monetary policy stance. Box F: Insights from the Forecast Evaluation Report Analysis of forecast performance is important to help identify strengths in, and opportunities to build on, the MPC’s understanding of the economy. The recently published Forecast Evaluation Report finds that the Bank’s forecasts have performed at least as well as external forecasters and model-based approaches over time. It also sets out some areas for improvement in the Bank’s standard models, highlighting the importance of drawing on a wide range of models and analytical inputs when setting monetary policy. The role of the Bank’s forecasts in the MPC’s policy framework has been evolving ( Bernanke (2024) and Dhami et al (2025) ), but they remain an important element of the wider range of inputs into the MPC’s policy decisions. Evaluating how the Bank’s forecasts have performed as predictors of economic outcomes is therefore important to help identify strengths and areas for improvement in the MPC’s understanding of the economy. The Bank recently published its first Forecast Evaluation Report (FER), with approaches underpinned by a new forecast evaluation toolkit ( Abiry et al (2026) and Bank of England GitHub ). The Report in part responds to Bernanke’s (2024) recommendations for the Bank to build on its previous forecast evaluation efforts, and to do more to identify and explain its forecast errors. Drawing on some of the Report’s findings, this box summarises how the economy has evolved relative to the Bank’s forecasts and some takeaways for the MPC. How has the economy evolved relative to the Bank’s forecasts in recent years? The current economic outlook is, in part, shaped by the series of significant economic shocks the UK has faced in recent years. These have made forecasting over this period particularly challenging. The UK economy has faced a sequence of historically large shocks over the past few years ( Bailey (2023) , Pill (2024) , Mann (2025) , Taylor (2025) ). That sequence of shocks alongside a number of structural changes continues to be felt in current economic conditions. They have also made forecasting over this period particularly challenging, and, as noted by Bernanke (2024) , have meant that central banks across the world, including the Bank, have made larger forecast errors than in previous years. Consistent with that, the FER shows that the accuracy of the Bank’s forecasts, as measured by root mean squared errors, has deteriorated compared to the pre-pandemic period. Charts F.1 and F.2 show realised data outturns compared with successive Bank forecasts since August 2021. These suggest, on average, that outturns have been higher than forecast for CPI inflation, GDP growth and wage growth, and below forecasts for the unemployment rate. Chart F.1: CPI inflation and GDP growth outturns have tended to exceed forecasts Forecasts and outturns for CPI inflation and GDP growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Latest data points shown are for 2025 Q3, except for CPI inflation for which latest data points shown are for 2025 Q4. Lines in light purple show the successive Bank forecasts for each variable, including those published alongside the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report up to the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report. Lines in orange show forecasts as at the time of the August 2024 Monetary Policy Report, which is one year prior to the latest available data point. Forecasts shown are for four-quarter growth in GDP and CPI inflation (seasonally adjusted). Chart F.2: Wage growth has tended to be stronger than expected over the past five years, while unemployment has been higher than projected a year ago Forecasts and outturns for wage growth and unemployment ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Refer to Chart F.1. Forecasts shown are for four-quarter growth in whole-economy total average weekly earnings and for the level of the unemployment rate. Data outturns for CPI inflation, GDP growth, wage growth and the unemployment rate have been higher than forecast in the August 2024 projections. These charts also highlight how data outturns have evolved relative to the projections published in the August 2024 Monetary Policy Report (Charts F.1 and F.2, orange lines). These suggest that errors have generally been smaller over this more recent period than on average over the past five years. CPI inflation has been higher than projected in August 2024. That difference partly reflects particularly strong food price inflation and changes announced in Autumn Budget 2024, such as increases in a number of administered prices and employer NICs. It also partly reflects stronger-than-expected wage growth. Wage growth has fallen back over the past year, but by less than had been expected in the August 2024 Report. The Bank’s models partly attribute this news to inflation expectations, which have been stronger than their historical relationships with other variables would suggest, and the increase in employer NICs. As outlined in previous Monetary Policy Reports, however, those models have struggled to explain some of the recent strength in wage growth, suggesting some role for more persistent inflationary pressures or structural factors (Box F of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). The analysis on heterogeneity in wage-setting presented in Box B does not find evidence for the role of structural factors, however. GDP growth has exceeded projections from August 2024, with the difference partly reflecting looser than previously announced fiscal policy alongside an easing in financial conditions. The unemployment rate has also been higher than the August 2024 expectation. This contrasts with the past five years, when outturns have tended to be lower than projected on average. The larger-than-expected rise in unemployment may reflect an increase in structural unemployment, owing in part to increases in labour costs (Section 3.2), or could reflect a cyclical reversal in the excess hiring observed after the pandemic. Over the past five years, inflation has been stronger than expected on average, with the peak upside inflation forecast error occurring in late 2022… Building on this overview of the performance of the most recent forecasts, the FER explores some of the drivers of the Bank’s forecast errors over the past five years in greater detail. Forecast errors have generally been larger over this period. On average, since mid-2021, inflation outturns have tended to come in stronger than the Bank’s forecasts (Chart F.1, left panel). The peak one year ahead inflation forecast error was in October 2022 when CPI inflation reached 11.1%, 8 percentage points above the forecast produced in August 2021. Bank staff estimates suggest that half of that peak forecast error reflected the rise in energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Higher-than-expected global export prices can explain much of the remainder. …persistence in domestic wage and price setting, which was not well captured by the Bank’s standard models, explains some of the forecast errors after that peak. The Bank’s medium-term inflation forecasts were also repeatedly too low, on average, after the inflation peak in 2022. The initial shocks, which led to the sharp rises in inflation, also resulted in more persistent domestic price and wage increases, or second-round effects. Consistent with that, stronger-than-expected inflation outturns were accompanied by stronger-than-expected wage outturns. As discussed previously, it is also possible that the persistent strength in wage and price growth may have reflected structural changes in wage-setting behaviour. The MPC applied judgements in real time to help account for these persistence effects, which were not well captured by the Bank’s standard models. These persistence judgements reduced the size of the inflation forecast errors over this period. As estimating the size and speed of those effects is challenging, those judgements have been informed by a range of other model estimates and analysis and updated over time to reflect new information. The latest version of the MPC’s persistence judgements suggests second-round effects will push up on annual inflation until end-2027 (Chart 3.2 in Section 3.1). There remain risks and uncertainty around the strengths of these mechanisms and how quickly they might fade. Exploring the risks that greater inflation persistence might present to the MPC’s central projections has informed a number of recent scenarios ( May 2025 Monetary Policy Report and November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). GDP growth has been stronger than forecasts on average since mid-2021. GDP growth has, on average, exceeded forecasts since mid-2021 (Chart F.1, right panel). During this period, growth was initially weaker than the Bank’s projections due to the unanticipated surge in energy prices and higher interest rates in response to rising inflation. Growth later outperformed expectations as energy prices fell faster than anticipated, the hit to activity proved smaller, and fiscal support helped limit the impact on household incomes. In more recent years, positive GDP surprises have also coincided with less economic slack, which also reflects estimates of potential supply growth having been judged to be slightly weaker than expected. A series of significant shocks have weighed on potential supply, such as the after-effects of the pandemic, the energy price shock and the change in trading relationships with the EU ( Bailey (2023) ). Longer-term statistical analysis identified the Bank’s labour market forecasts as an area for improvement. The FER also includes some longer-term statistical analysis, which evaluates forecast performance over the past 10 years. This analysis pointed to the Bank’s labour market forecasts as an area for improvement. The Report’s findings suggest that forecast errors for wage growth have been skewed in opposite directions either side of the pandemic. And the unemployment rate has been overpredicted on average since 2015, even though it has been underpredicted in the most recent forecasts. There is also evidence that both the wage and unemployment forecasts could have made better use of information that was available at the times the forecasts were made. What do the FER findings mean for the MPC? The FER finds the Bank’s forecasts are at least as accurate as alternative forecasts, although there is still more to do to advance the Bank’s understanding of the mechanisms driving some forecast errors, particularly on the labour market. The FER finds the Bank’s forecasts have been at least as accurate as the average of external forecasters and a range of model-based alternatives over the past decade, consistent with findings from the Bernanke Review (2024) . While the accuracy of the Bank’s forecasts has reduced since 2020, that is also true of the range of comparable benchmarks. As noted above, the FER points to the labour market and wage‑price dynamics as key areas for model improvement, with the post‑2022 persistence of inflation and robust wage growth underscoring the importance of better capturing links between labour‑market tightness, wage growth, CPI inflation and inflation expectations. Expanding on work in these areas would represent a further step towards the ‘continuous learning’ about the structure of the economy that the Bernanke Review recommends ( Lombardelli (2024) ). These findings further highlight the importance of the MPC drawing on a range of inputs, alongside the central projections, to inform members’ judgements and understanding of the economic outlook. The MPC often draws on alternative models, diverse data sources or analysis to inform the judgements layered on the forecasts (for example, the MPC persistence judgements and MPC judgements to boost demand over 2023 (Key judgement 2 in the February 2023 Monetary Policy Report )), or in some cases to help Committee members outline where their views on the economic outlook differ from the central projections (as set out for example in the MPC members’ views section of the February 2026 Monetary Policy Summary and Minutes ). The FER findings further highlight the importance of the MPC continuing to draw on sources that offer alternative views on economic mechanisms, particularly those that the Bank’s standard forecasts tend to capture less well.

Annex 2: Model-based policy simulations Annex 2: Model-based policy simulations At its meeting ending on 17 December 2025, the Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%. Four members voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. CPI inflation had fallen since the previous meeting, to 3.2%. Although above the 2% target, it was now expected to fall back towards target more quickly in the near term. Reflecting restrictive monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation had continued to ease. Monetary policy was being set to ensure CPI inflation settled sustainably at 2% in the medium term, which involved balancing the risks around achieving this. The risk from greater inflation persistence had become somewhat less pronounced since the November meeting, while the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand remained. The extent of further easing in monetary policy would depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. The restrictiveness of policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the evidence, Bank Rate was likely to continue on a gradual downward path. But judgements around further policy easing would become a closer call.

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 25 read with Section 23 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. A statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the bank’s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The bank had failed to submit credit information of its customers to any of the Credit Information Companies (CICs). This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers.

My colleagues and I are pleased to be here today to answer your questions. These hearings are an important part of the accountability process for the Reserve Bank. As you know, our mission is to promote the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people, now and into the future. We do this by conducting monetary policy with the aim of maintaining low and stable inflation and full employment, and we also support the stability of the financial system. But our responsibilities go beyond this – we work to support a reliable, efficient and competitive payments system, deliver efficient and effective banking services to Australian government agencies and provide secure and reliable banknotes. Since we last met with the Committee, the Monetary Policy Board judged that it was appropriate to tighten monetary policy to help to return inflation to target. I will start with some background to this decision and the outlook for the Australian economy. I’ll then make some remarks on the payments system and cash distribution. And I’ll finish off with an update on our progress towards achieving the objectives of the RBA Review. Inflation and employment As I noted, the Monetary Policy Board conducts monetary policy with the aim of maintaining low and stable inflation and full employment. The Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy sets out our agreement with the Government that an appropriate goal is consumer price inflation between 2 and 3 per cent. To achieve this, we set policy such that inflation is expected to return to the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent target range. But there is flexibility around the timeframe in which we meet our inflation objective to balance this with meeting our full employment objective – achieving the maximum level of employment that is consistent with low and stable inflation in the medium term. On the first part of our mandate, inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022. However, after a period of being within the 2–3 per cent target range, inflation picked up over the second half of 2025 to be materially higher than earlier anticipated. Underlying (trimmed mean) inflation – which removes the more volatile movements in any given quarter – had been easing and reached 2.7 per cent in mid-2025, before increasing to 3.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter 2025. The pick-up in inflation over the second half of 2025 was observed across a broad range of categories, including for services, retail goods and the cost of building new homes. Headline inflation – which has been affected by temporary cost-of-living relief measures – increased to be 3.6 per cent over the year to the December quarter. On the second part of our mandate, various indicators continue to suggest that labour market conditions remain close to, if a little tighter than, full employment. After a period of easing, labour market conditions have stabilised in recent months, in line with the pick-up in the growth of demand. The unemployment rate, which averaged 4.2 per cent in the December quarter, is low by historical standards – and the share of the population with a job is close to a record high. There are 1.7 million more Australians in employment since the start of the pandemic. This is a welcome development for those individuals, their families and the wider Australian economy. Recent monetary policy decisions and the economic outlook Earlier this week the Monetary Policy Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent. As I mentioned earlier, while inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it picked up materially in the second half of 2025. As recently as August 2025, we were forecasting inflation to be sustainably back within the 2–3 per cent band by this year. Private demand had picked up but was not growing particularly strongly. Labour market conditions were easing gradually. And the world economy looked very uncertain, with global growth forecasts revised downwards. But over the second half of 2025, this picture progressively turned around, with a range of data increasingly suggesting that international conditions, domestic demand and inflation were turning out stronger than we expected. The Monetary Policy Board highlighted this evolving assessment in the statements accompanying its November and December meetings. Much of the recent increase in inflation is judged to be temporary – but some of it seems to be persistent. Indeed, our outlook now sees inflation not coming back into the target band until the middle of next year. What has driven this change in outlook? There are a few factors. First, financial conditions have eased. We previously judged monetary policy to have remained a bit restrictive through 2025 – but the recent inflation data and the pick-up in credit growth cast some question over this. Second, the world economy has proved much more resilient than expected so that growth in our major trading partners has been much stronger than forecast. This partly reflects the resilience of the global trading system, which has adjusted faster than expected to tariff changes. But it’s also a consequence of the ongoing boom in AI investment, which has spilled over to a number of high-income Asian economies that supply chips and other key inputs. Third, private demand looks to have increased more strongly over the latter part of last year than we were expecting. Household consumption and business investment both drove this strength. Consistent with that strengthening of demand, the labour market has been a bit stronger than expected since November, and we judge that it remains a bit tight. We hear from surveys and our own liaison that some firms are still finding it difficult to find staff with the right skills and experience. This is another symptom of excess demand for goods and services in the economy. Given the inflation outcomes, the Board judged that stronger-than-expected demand in aggregate was pushing up against the ability of the economy to supply all of the goods and services being demanded. In other words, there was more excess demand in the economy than earlier judged. This means that we need to dampen the growth of demand, unless the supply side of the economy can expand a little quicker. This is where productivity comes in. Faster productivity growth allows for stronger growth in incomes and spending without the emergence of inflationary pressures. Based on its assessment that the economy is more capacity constrained, the Board judged that monetary policy needed to be tighter, to dampen aggregate demand growth and to help to return the economy to balance over the forecast period. It therefore judged that it was appropriate to raise the cash rate. There are of course risks to this outlook – forecasts are always uncertain. One that the Board will be monitoring closely is the extent to which the stronger inflation we have observed is persistent or temporary – that is, the extent to which the economy is capacity constrained. The Board will be closely monitoring the incoming data and continually assessing the extent of capacity constraints. If growth in demand is stronger than expected, and growth in the economy’s supply capacity remains limited, it is likely to add further to capacity pressures, and hence inflation persistence. If demand growth is weaker, or supply growth is stronger, inflation may return towards target more quickly. Significant uncertainties also remain in the global economy, with elevated trade and geopolitical risks: circumstances could change quickly. I recognise the challenges that the cash rate increase brings for Australians with mortgages. But it is the right thing for the economy as a whole. We need to ensure that inflation is low and stable so that households and businesses can plan, invest and create jobs. High inflation hurts all Australians – whether you’re paying a mortgage, renting, running a business, or just trying to make ends meet. It is especially tough on people with lower incomes and those in more vulnerable situations. Payments system Another key responsibility for the RBA is our regulation and oversight of the payments system. The RBA is committed to promoting and supporting a modern and innovative payment system in Australia. We are completing our review of surcharging and merchant card payment costs. This review has benefited from extensive engagement from a broad range of stakeholders, including over 170 written submissions to our consultation paper. The staff have also conducted over 100 bilateral meetings and gathered additional evidence from stakeholders. The Payments System Board will publish its conclusions by the end of March 2026. After the review of merchant card payment costs and surcharging, we will consult on which issues should be prioritised by the RBA under the amended Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 . These amendments expanded the RBA’s remit to a broader range of payment systems and their participants – including three-party card schemes, mobile wallets, ‘buy-now, pay-later’ providers and e-commerce platforms. This consultation is expected to take place in mid-2026. We acknowledge that on 8 December 2025 this Committee commenced its Inquiry into Schemes, Digital Wallets and Innovation in the Payments Sector . The RBA has made a submission to the inquiry and looks forward to your deliberations. We see the Committee’s work as complementary and concurrent to the RBA’s own consultations in the payments area. The RBA has also contributed to the Council of Financial Regulators ‘Better Regulation Roadmap’, which is promoting streamlined regulation to help drive stronger productivity growth in our economy. As part of this, the RBA is supporting innovation by exploring how new forms of digital money can support tokenised asset markets and creating a plan for modernising Australia’s core settlement infrastructure – the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS). I also wanted to note that on 27 January, the RBA experienced a system issue that disrupted some payment and property settlement services. We restored settlement for these services in the afternoon, but a second issue for property settlements meant that full restoration was not achieved until the evening. We apologise for the disruption caused by the incident. We recognise the critical role we play in the payments system and are conducting a full review of the incident, which we plan to publish before the end of February. This incident reinforces the importance of the RBA’s active program of work to strengthen the operational stability of its critical settlement systems. Cash distribution I would also like to update the Committee on recent developments in the cash distribution system. Cash remains a critical part of an inclusive and resilient payments system. Although the use of cash for everyday payments has declined in recent decades, a range of indicators suggest cash use has stabilised in the past few years. The RBA remains committed to supporting the Australian Government’s policy objective to ensure cash remains a viable means of payment for as long as Australians want or need to use it. The cash distribution system has faced significant challenges. These issues are most pressing for rural and regional areas. The industry needs to work together towards a more sustainable distribution system that supports the needs of all Australians. Linfox Armaguard – which is the main provider of cash-in-transit services – and its major banking and retail customers have been working towards a future pricing model. This is aimed at supporting more sustainable and efficient distribution arrangements. Any proposed model would need to be considered by the ACCC. As the issuer of Australian banknotes, the RBA also plays a key role in cash distribution. We provide banknotes to the major banks, who distribute these to the broader community. We are continuing to work with industry so that the RBA’s arrangements and incentives support efficient distribution and encourage banks to hold cash across the country. We also continue to work closely with other public agencies to support the long-term availability of cash in the public interest. The Council of Financial Regulators (CFR), which I chair, together with the ACCC, is taking an active interest in cash distribution. Last year, the CFR and ACCC jointly consulted on potential regulatory guardrails to support resilience and fair access to critical cash distribution services. The Government also recently introduced a mandate for large grocery stores and petrol stations to accept cash, which aims to support Australians who want to pay in cash for essential goods. Progress towards achieving the objectives from the Review of the RBA to be fit for the future As you know, the RBA Review was released in April 2023. The Review recognised the RBA’s longstanding contribution to Australia’s economic success and the professionalism of our staff, while identifying areas for improvement. It focused on a few key areas – monetary policy, governance, transparency and culture – that are central to our effectiveness as Australia’s central bank. The findings from the Review have shaped our transformation agenda since that time. Some recommendations from the Review involved actions that we could undertake ourselves – changes to the number and timing of Board meetings, our Board processes, and our culture and leadership capabilities. But other recommendations required legislative change, including the creation of a separate Governance Board. So, in March 2025, the most significant reforms to the RBA since the 1990s came into effect. Our work is now overseen by three boards: the Governance Board, the Monetary Policy Board and the Payments System Board. The Governance Board is now the accountable authority under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is effectively responsible for overseeing the operations of the RBA including strategy, risk, resourcing, budget and the balance sheet. But there is one important difference with boards in commercial organisations – we are a policy institution and so there are circumstances where policy takes precedence over normal commercial considerations. A good example is use of the balance sheet for monetary policy or financial stability considerations. Nevertheless, the creation of the Governance Board has sharpened our focus, strengthened decision-making and improved accountability, supporting our commitment to modernising the RBA. In line with its new responsibilities, the Governance Board published a report on our progress in meeting the recommendations of the Review in December last year. To date, the RBA and the Government have addressed 41 of the 51 recommendations. Clear implementation plans are in place for the remaining recommendations, and the necessary work is well under way. We will implement two further recommendations in 2026: publication of a framework for additional monetary policy tools and convening of an external expert advisory group on monetary policy. The remaining recommendations are ongoing commitments, where we have established the structures, processes and capabilities needed to sustain progress in these areas. They include initiatives to strengthen leadership, embed cultural change, enhance analytical expertise and deepen our understanding of monetary and fiscal policy interactions. We have also committed to conducting future reviews of the monetary policy framework and our institutional capability. Our work does not end with the implementation of specific recommendations. In the spirit of the Review, we are embracing a mindset of continuous improvement – recognising that the environment in which we operate is dynamic and that our institutional practices must continue to evolve. We remain committed to pursuing excellence in everything we do as we build an RBA that is fit for the future. I will finish on that note.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank The Economist for the invitation to address The World Ahead 2026 here in Athens. In a year that will test economic and geopolitical resilience, I would like to briefly assess the current state of the Greek and European banking sectors and then turn to the main risks and challenges that lie ahead. Over the past decade, the Greek banking sector has undergone a profound transformation, with balance sheets, profitability, liquidity and capital positions improving substantially, in line with Greece's macroeconomic recovery, positive fiscal developments, and the normalisation of financial conditions. In fact, one of the important lessons from Greece's experience is the strong interaction between the recovery of the economy, its improving fiscal situation and the positive course of the banking sector through a virtuous feedback loop. Greek banks have effectively completed the clean-up of their balance sheets. Since March 2016 – when non-performing loans peaked – the total reduction in the stock of legacy loans has reached 95%. A key driver of this reduction has been the set-up of the Hellenic Asset Protection Scheme (HAPS), which facilitated large-scale NPL securitisations through state guarantees on senior notes. As a result, by Q3 2025 the system-wide NPL ratio had declined to 3.6%. Domestic liquidity conditions remain ample, reflecting strong deposit growth and stable market access. Deposits continue to increase, while all banks enjoy undisrupted access to wholesale funding markets, supporting their capacity to finance the real economy. Bank profitability remains solid and broad-based, supported by credit expansion and high operating efficiency. Credit growth has been concentrated mainly in lending to non-financial corporations, including projects related to the RRF. Moreover, the low cost of credit risk and high cost efficiency have also supported profitability. Overall, system-wide Return on Equity has strengthened, reaching double-digit levels of around 12%. Banks have also taken steps to diversify their income sources and expand their business activity beyond traditional domestic credit. Recent examples include Eurobank's and Alpha Bank's acquisitions of Hellenic Bank and AstroBank, respectively, in Cyprus, as well as the acquisitions of Ethniki Insurance and Eurolife by Piraeus Bank and Eurobank, respectively. Moreover, Alpha Bank has established a strategic partnership with UniCredit in Romania, while UniCredit has also acquired a stake of around 30% in Alpha Bank. In addition, CrediaBank has reached an agreement to acquire HSBC's subsidiary in Malta. These transactions reflect a more outward-looking business model and greater regional integration. Improved profitability and capital-accretive actions have strengthened banks' capital positions. Capital adequacy currently stands at around 20%, well above regulatory requirements, enhancing loss-absorption capacity. These improvements are also reflected in supervisory assessments and market confidence. No Greek significant institution is currently classified in the lowest and most risky category, marking a clear shift from crisis management to more business-as-usual supervision. This progress enabled dividend distributions in 2024, the first in 15 years. Finally, the clean-up of less significant institutions has strengthened competition within the Greek banking sector. The recapitalisation of CrediaBank, following the absorption of Pancreta, together with NPL disposals under the Hellenic Asset Protection Scheme, has effectively created a ""fifth pole"" of smaller but sound banks alongside the significant institutions. Overall, the Greek banking sector is now in a much stronger position to support economic growth and absorb potential shocks. Enhanced resilience (confirmed by the results of the recent EU-wide stress testing exercise), improved market access and the restoration of investment-grade conditions, provide a solid foundation going into 2026, which is particularly important in an environment characterised by high uncertainty. The improvement observed in Greece mirrors a broader strengthening of the European banking sector. European banks have gradually rebuilt resilience since the Global Financial Crisis. Based on the latest available data: 1 Capital buffers across the EU banking sector have increased substantially over time. While the total Capital Ratio stood at just 13% in December 2009, it reached 20.4% by September 2025, supported by strong profitability and capital-enhancing measures. Asset quality has improved markedly, representing one of the most significant achievements of the past decade. The average NPL ratio declined from nearly 7% in 2016 to just 1.8% in September 2025. Profitability has also recovered, after a prolonged period of weak returns. After years of marginal returns, EU banks recorded an average Return on Equity of 10.7% by September 2025, supporting internal capital generation. Despite stronger fundamentals for European and Greek banks, the outlook for 2026 remains subject to significant downside risks. These risks stem mainly from external and structural factors. Geopolitical risk continues to be the dominant source of uncertainty for banks. Ongoing conflicts, trade tensions and tariffs may affect banks through weaker growth prospects and heightened market volatility. Cyber risk has emerged as a key operational and financial stability concern. The rising frequency of cyber incidents underlines the challenging environment and highlights the need for rapid remediation. Full compliance with DORA requirements, that is the EU Regulation for digital operational resilience for the financial sector, and the timely closure of any remaining gaps, are essential, while investment in digitalisation will enable banks to keep pace with technological developments and alleviate competitive pressure, especially by neobanks. Although asset quality remains strong, pockets of vulnerability require close monitoring. Certain segments of corporate and retail lending may face pressure, underscoring the need for prudent lending standards and the importance of proactive risk management. Structural challenges related to demographics and climate change pose longer-term risks. Population ageing, social cohesion pressures, climate and environmental risks could have material macroeconomic and financial implications. Regarding the latter, while banks in the euro area have made significant progress in managing climate-related risks, extreme weather events and rising global temperatures could still lead to sizeable economic and financial losses, particularly where insurance coverage remains limited. Contagion risks may arise from non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI's) and crypto-asset markets. These sectors can amplify shocks through liquidity and confidence channels, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive supervisory micro- and macroprudential approach. The role of NBFIs in the provision of financial services has grown significantly without a commensurate enhancement of the regulatory and supervisory framework. This renders NBFIs a potential source of systemic risk, particularly in the current environment of heightened geopolitical risks and elevated financial asset valuations. Specifically, the interlinkages between banks and NBFIs – spanning funding, credit and market activities – can amplify shocks and transmit stress across the global financial sector. For instance, these linkages can create vulnerabilities through loss of short-term NBFI funding and credit exposures to leveraged NBFIs, exposing banks to market shocks and liquidity pressures. In addition, vulnerabilities within NBFIs, especially from investment funds with high leverage and limited liquidity, could amplify adverse market dynamics through forced asset sales, reduced liquidity, and procyclical selling behavior. Contagion risks could also arise from the growing interlinkages between crypto-asset markets and the traditional financial system. Beyond financial stability concerns from this interconnectedness, a significant rapid expansion of stablecoins in the EU, especially those pegged to the USD, may interfere with the smooth transmission of monetary policy, the intermediation role of banks and the orderly market functioning, ultimately undermining monetary sovereignty. Furthermore, money laundering risks are ever present in the crypto sector and continue to pose significant challenges for effective supervision, especially when considering the relevant fragmented regulatory landscape at the global level. As supervisors, we are making conscious efforts to simplify our regulatory and supervisory framework while ensuring that resilience and the effectiveness in meeting prudential objectives is maintained. European harmonization and financial integration is fostered, and international cooperation (notably the compliance with Basel principles) is upheld. To this end, both the ECB and the SSM published late last year two reports that set the scene for a simpler regulatory and supervisory framework in the euro area. In conclusion, despite the progress achieved and the sound fundamentals of European and Greek banks, there is no room for complacency. With risks to financial stability remaining elevated, supervisors should ensure that financial institutions act prudently, preserve strong capital and liquidity buffers, and maintain high governance standards. At the same time, further institutional deepening at the European level remains essential: completing the Banking Union – particularly through the finalisation of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme with a clear and credible timetable – would reduce financial fragmentation and strengthen confidence, while advancing the Savings and Investment Union is key to mobilising private savings and fostering deeper and more efficient capital markets. Ultimately, strengthening financial and operational resilience is critical in an environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty. 1 https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard .

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good afternoon, everyone. Before we dive into the issue of digital dependence in Europe, let me start with a confession: I spent part of last weekend practicing my English pronunciation: fault lines versus vault lines. The first one with an 'F', the second one with a 'V'. Well-known examples of the first one are the San Andreas fault line in California, or the North Anatolian fault line in Turkey. And the thing about these fault lines, these often-unseen cracks, is that we know they are there, we know they can shake foundations and shatter lives, but we don't know when these powerful forces will strike. On the other hand, you have vault lines – with a V. When I'm talking about vaults, today, I'm not talking about the place we keep our gold, but about vaults as in arches of resilience. Whenever you visit the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, or the chapel of King's College in Cambridge, or any great chapel or church in Europe, and look up to the ceiling, you'll probably see them: those stone arches that carry the weight and absorb the strain. Those visible lines of strength, deliberately built, stone on stone, to withstand pressure. Those are the vault lines I'm talking about. They keep things together – prevent the roof from falling on our heads. And provide shelter and safety. Now, the reason I practiced these two words, similar in sound, but very different in meaning, is that the one – with an F – describes our current world, and the second – with a V – our future world, ideally, at least. How so? Well, let me start with our current world. Our financial system also has fault lines – cracks. And those cracks have a capacity, similar to any tectonic fault line, to cause crises. Today, I want to talk about one of those fault lines: Europe's digital dependence. Together with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets – the AFM – we wrote a report on this topic. We did this because, currently, many European financial institutions are entrusting more and more of their IT stack to a limited number of IT service providers. Cloud services are dominated by a few IT companies, the so-called hyperscalers. And, as you well know, many IT applications are built on these services. Often also for specialized services, for instance in cyber security, many financial institutions turn to a few smaller service providers. For sure, relying on one IT provider for cloud services has efficiency benefits and gives access to innovative service, but it also makes institutions vulnerable. Because if that one hyperscaler were to fail - or become the victim of a cyber-attack - the effects would be immediate. And if it were ordered by its government to halt services for certain customers, stability could be severely jeopardised. This concentration risk exposes a fault line in the financial sector. Because what seems stable today, might suddenly start to quiver and quake. And it is not just about concentration risk. Because reliance on the same few large IT providers has also created systemic risks. Meaning that in a system as interconnected as our financial system, the lights going off at one hyperscaler, could very possibly affect the entire financial system. It is undeniable that the fault lines under our European financial system have become far more prone to cracking in recent years. Right on Europe's borders, a ruthless aggressor is waging hybrid warfare. At the same time, some of our longstanding global relationships have soured. Values once thought common, like privacy and the rule of law, are no longer self-evident. And when once-partners diverge on fundamental values, fissures appear, following decades of trust. And this puts our financial system at risk. Looking beyond these immediate threats, the DNB/AFM report sketches four directions that can shape Europe's digital footing: One – in a world with increasing geopolitical pressures, and a digital stand-still in Europe, we become a digital colony dominated by external forces. Two – in a world with increasing geopolitical pressures, but with a Europe that finds its own digital strength, we live in a fragmented world of separate technology spheres. Three – in a world with DE-creasing geopolitical tensions, but still with a digital stand-still in Europa, we remain digitally dependent on non-European IT providers. And four – in a world with DE-creasing geopolitical tensions AND with a Europe that finds its own digital strength, we succeed in creating a human-centred path of digitalisation, meaning that European IT capabilities grow, our digital dependence declines, and all of this happens in sync with European values such as privacy, and the rule of law. Obviously, now that we are aware of the risks of the fault line that our digital dependence represents, the fourth scenario is the one to prefer. But since this is also the hardest one of the four to achieve, action is urgent. So, where to start? Indeed, as I said at the outset, looking ahead requires a shift in perspective. From what breaks to what endures. From what threatens to what protects. From the fault lines with an F to the vault lines with a V. That is what we need in our financial system: strong structures and stable partnerships, built on shared values, to protect our system from shocks caused by the cracks beneath the surface. In the near term, these vault lines – with a V – will consist of preparing ourselves the best we can – given our state of dependence. Today, independence is not on the table, because it is simply not available. It is not yet attainable. No European alternative is adequate to take the place of one of the big non-European IT providers. And so, preparation is key – for instance by developing and rehearsing actual threat scenarios. In doing so, two fast-moving situations should receive special emphasis: hybrid attacks – meaning a combination of physical and digital attacks – that disrupt shared infrastructure, and sanctions that force key third-party suppliers to suspend services. Financial institutions are already working together closely on this by sharing vital information. In our report, we urge them to also test whole chains of systems with their main suppliers, and as such learn how disruptions might spread. This helps to spot weak points early and to contain problems before they can shake the entire system. The AFM and DNB stand ready to facilitate this work wherever we can be of assistance. A good practice we found at a few financial institutions, is investing in more flexibility – wherever possible. As such, they redesign applications to improve portability, adopt open standards and use container technologies to reduce dependency. Procurement practices are also shifting in this direction. We see that financial institutions are broadening their vendor base and exploring multi-vendor strategies. These steps do not eliminate dependency risks, but they do provide institutions with more options when conditions change. One essential vault line – with a V – which the European financial sector needs to construct or strengthen, is control over its data. In this regard, it is promising that financial institutions are looking more and more often at European IT providers. They are also reassessing the European variants offered by global hyperscalers – the so-called EU sovereign cloud offerings. In that last scenario, the central question remains, of course, whether any of these arrangements truly strengthens control and resilience when circumstances become difficult, and a foreign government starts threatening. In our report, we suggest that financial institutions increasingly retain their own encryption keys. This would ensure, in the near term, that the protection of critical information remains firmly under their stewardship. All in all, financial institutions must assess all available options carefully and plan for continuity. Of course, switching providers is never simple – it is costly and time-consuming, even if we expect or eventually even compel providers to facilitate this when asked to. But preparation matters. It shows institutions what can realistically be done when disruption strikes and where additional work is still needed. In this way, they strengthen the vault lines that help the system hold firm when the ground begins to shake. Now, turning to the longer term, the goal is pretty straightforward: we need to reduce our reliance on non-European providers. And we need to do this by reinforcing Europe's digital capabilities and addressing the causes of our current dependency. This long-term goal is a joint project of the European tech industry, the financial sector and public authorities. And yes, policy is already moving in the right direction. We already see protective vault lines emerging in legislation like DORA – the European Digital Operational Resilience Act, which entered into force in January 2025. But truth be told, even with DORA in place, vulnerabilities persist – especially those that are linked to geopolitical developments and to the location of critical data. DORA provides a good start, but we must continue to focus on key vulnerabilities, like concentration risks, who has jurisdiction over critical data and applications, and how far supervisory powers extend. In order to develop European IT capabilities, we must get to work. Earlier, I described four possible scenarios for our digital future. To realise the preferred fourth scenario, the one in which Europe leads the way in promoting human-centred digitalisation, will demand time, determination and sustained investment in European IT. As such, where possible, financial institutions should work more closely with European IT providers for critical services. By aligning specifications, running coordinated tests, and offering purchase guarantees, they can help create the scale needed for viable and competitive European cloud providers to emerge. But scale alone is not enough. To truly strengthen Europe's digital footing, we also need joined testing. For instance, when it comes to the security of the entire chain of operations, from primary IT providers to every subcontractor involved. Joint testing helps us spot vulnerabilities early, before they can spread through the system. And even that is only part of the answer. To genuinely build Europe's digital strength, we must also invest in the companies capable of delivering it. That means strengthening the savings and investment union, so that more European capital flows to innovative European firms - the firms that can build the digital services we will rely on tomorrow. And yes, where necessary we must also improve regulation - making oversight more enforceable, clarifying expectations on geopolitical risk and data location, and, in due course, considering a cross-sector European cloud supervisor. By continuing to work together – financial institutions, policy makers, and the European tech industry – we can gradually reduce our digital dependencies and strengthen the resilience of our financial sector. Step by step, we can shift from merely spotting the fault lines that may fracture beneath us to actively reinforcing the vault lines that keep Europe's financial system safe and secure. And if you still can't hear the difference between fault with and F and vault with a V, don't worry. Just remember: the first one cracks, the second one endures. Thank you.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear representatives of the EBRD, Dear friends, colleagues and media representatives, It is a pleasure to welcome you to the presentation of this year's EBRD Transition Report, which focuses on one of the most powerful yet often underestimated forces shaping our economies and societies: demographic change. Demography might seem like an abstract concept, but it is a fundamental force of development and prosperity. It evolves slowly, over cycles far longer than business or financial ones. This is precisely why it is not always at the centre of policy or central banking debates. However, we are currently living through a global demographic turning point and that begs our attention. As fewer people enter the labour force, more depend on pension and healthcare systems. These shifts are already putting pressure on productivity, public finances, political priorities, and long-term growth prospects across regions. At the Bank of Albania, we have been concerned about these issues and demographic developments for almost a decade. Population ageing and emigration are early identified as defining challenges for Albania's economic future. Our country mirrors many of the trends described in this report: rapid ageing combined with significant outflows of young and working-aged people. According to united nations projections, these dynamics are expected not only to persist, but to intensify in the years ahead, leading to a reversal of the demographic pyramid. Rapid demographic transformation is reshaping Albania's economy and society, which are now facing similar challenges with the one highlighted in the Transition Report. The population has been steadily declining while the average age is rising rapidly. The 2023 census records about 2.4 million inhabitants, roughly one third fewer than 1990. In the meantime, the average age has reached nearly 43 years. Emigration, once viewed as a mitigating factor for unemployment and poverty, is increasingly emerging as a structural challenge. Sustained economic growth, historically low unemployment, and labour shortages in key sectors have made the long-term consequences of demographic change more visible to both businesses and households. Population ageing affects both aggregate demand and supply: it alters consumption patterns, weakens innovation and productivity, raises production costs, and ultimately influences prices, investment, and productive capacity, thereby undermining the long-term sustainability of economic growth. Bank of Albania reports and analyses have repeatedly emphasized the adverse effects of these trends on the labour market, wages, inflation dynamics, and Albania's long run growth potential. The Albanian economy has however shown strong adaptability and resilience in recent years, supported by low inflation, sustained economic growth, rising employment and wages, an improving current account. Labor market conditions have improved markedly, with employment rising, unemployment falling to historically low levels, and labour productivity substantially higher than before the global financial crisis. Up to this moment, the market has adjusted and offset demographic pressures through the increase in participation rate which however this comes at the cost of higher wages and therefore more inflation pressures. The Bank of Albania has played a key role in these developments through a prudent, consistent, and proactive monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability and safeguarding purchasing power. Since mid-2024, the accommodative policy stance has helped anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty, and improve financial conditions, leading to lower borrowing costs and robust credit growth. In parallel, the banking sector has continued to strengthen, with improved indicators of liquidity, capitalization, and asset quality, while systemic risks remain contained. This solid financial position ensures that the banking system can continue to support economic activity through effective financial intermediation. Despite this success, negative demographic trends in Albania are expected to be persistent. Our studies show that they will likely put downward pressure on real interest rates. This environment limits the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy, as low interest rates leave central banks with less room to stimulate the economy. At the same time, demographic shifts may also complicate inflation dynamics. Our research shows that increase in labour market participation rate comes at the cost of higher wages. These national findings strongly resonate with the broader conclusions of the EBRD Transition Report. Across Emerging Europe, ageing populations and shrinking workforces are weighing on growth. However, policy response requires coordinated action and political will. These reforms require courage and honesty. They should deal with reforming pension systems, modernizing labour markets, designing realistic migration frameworks, and investing in healthy ageing. It also means embracing new technologies, including artificial intelligence, responsibly and inclusively. Above all, it requires ensuring that younger generations, whose voices risk being diluted, remain central to economic decision-making. Let me conclude with the central message of this year's Transition Report: demography does not have to be destiny. The report offers a rigorous and policy-relevant framework to understand demographic change and its economic implications. I hope it will serve not only as an analytical reference, but also as a catalyst for informed debate and decisive action. Thank you and I wish you a fruitful discussion of this Report!

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Happy New Year. It is always a great privilege to be invited to this gathering of [Rotary Club of] Makati West and Manila. What I will do is basically tell the same story that [Past Vice President] Joel [Valdes] has told, but I will assign some numbers to that story. I will talk about good news, and then I will talk about bad news. Although I would say the bad news is not that bad. The first piece of good news, I would say, is inflation. Inflation is down. We managed to tame inflation over the past two years. Not only is inflation down, it is even lower for the bottom 30 percent of households. So, we pay a lot of attention not just to the inflation rate in general, but also the inflation rate for the bottom 30 percent. So, blue [referring to a graph] is the inflation rate as measured. We call it headline inflation and then [the] red is the inflation rate that is based on the consumer basket of the bottom 30 percent. So, the blue one is 1.8 [percent] as of a few days ago for December and the red one is 1.1 percent. [They are] pretty low inflation rates, although we project that the inflation rates will start to rise over the next year or so. That is the first piece of good news. The second piece of good news I would say is-our banking system is in good shape. The way we measure the health of banking system, we look at capital adequacy and the international standard for capital adequacy in the way it is measured by central banks [which] says that it should be at least 10 percent. By capital adequacy, we mean when we measure whether it is adequate or not, we assign risk weights to various assets of the banks, and then there should be sufficient capital to support those risks. It is not just 10 percent for us, it is 16.4 percent, so that is pretty good. And then you also look at the liquidity of banks. In case there is a deposit run, the bank should have sufficient liquidity to support the run. The international standard for that is 100 percent. The way we measure the liquidity for our banks, it is [at] 180 percent. So, our banks are not just well capitalized, they are also very liquid. And then we also have international reserves. This is our protection against a balance of payments crisis. As of today, we hold US$110.9 billion of international reserves. That is more than seven months of imports. The usual standard is three months of imports. We are at seven months of imports. And then we are also at four times our short-term debt. The international standard for that is the same amount of short-term debt so, 100 percent of short-term debt. We are at 400 percent of short-term debt. So that is the good news. Let me go to the bad news. So, as you know, our growth has slowed down so we now think that for 2025, we will see 4.6-percent growth for the whole year. The difference between that and the growth we thought would be before the flood control scandal is given by that light brown portion [on the chart]. We thought growth would be 5.7 percent in 2025. Now it looks like more like 4.6 percent. That is mainly the effect of the loss of confidence, the weakness of sentiment because of the flood control scandal. [And] that loss of confidence started in the third quarter of 2025. We do think there will be some recovery in 2026. We think the growth rate will be [at] 5.6 percent. It is lower than what we thought it would be, but not much lower. By the way, these numbers are not too different when you look at the projections by the IMF (International Monetary Fund), by Bloomberg, and by the World Bank Although I think our projections are more accurate because we have a more sophisticated forecasting model. We take account of investor sentiment; we take account of many things that the IMF has not taken into account. And then we think there will be a strong recovery from that. So, I think we can manage 6.3 percent in 2027. If we can achieve that, that would be very good. By the way, all these other numbers, even those for 2025 and 2026, are better than those of our neighbors, in spite of the loss of sentiment. These numbers are better than Indonesia's, better than Malaysia's, better than Thailand's. The only country in the region that is doing better than us is Vietnam. So, that is where we stand. Let me show you one picture about sentiment. We look at many indicators of sentiment, and we stick those indicators into our models. They are tested by history. These things work historically. One thing we look at is what is called the PMI, the purchasing managers index. This is a good indicator. This is something that is also a good indicator for other countries. For the US, it is called the ISM (Institute for Supply Management) number. It is good because in the value chain, the guys who look into the future most seriously are the purchasing managers. They have to purchase [the] inventory of their production. They have to take account very seriously of the next year or so. And that number--by the way. there are two versions of it, but they both behave in the same way-that number started to fall in July and now about a month ago, it reached bottom. It has now started to go up. The other number is what you guys all look at: the stock exchange numbers, the foreign exchange rate, and so on. The stock exchange-the index-has fallen since the crisis, but now it has shown some recovery. So, the stock market is saying there is hope. So, those are the indicators that we look at. I think you all know that we reduced the policy rate in the last meeting. In December, we reduced the policy rate. That was an effort to compensate for the loss of confidence. We can only influence the demand side of things. We have no tools for the supply side. But on the demand side, if there is a loss of confidence, we can compensate for it a little bit by lowering the policy risk. But I think we were very close to the end of the easing cycle. There is only so much we can do. We cannot completely restore confidence. So, that is my story. I would welcome a few questions.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Check against delivery 1 Introductory remarks Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the first Bundesbank Spotlight in Berlin! What is the idea behind the new event format? We want to engage in personal dialogue with experts in their fields and with our guests. The focus of our first Spotlight will be the digital euro. For this event, we have invited two guests to the podium, and I am delighted that they are able to be here today: Ramona Pop from the Federation of German Consume Organisations, and Christian Sewing – who will engage in today's discussion not only in his capacity as CEO of Deutsche Bank but also as President of the Association of German Banks. By introducing the digital euro, we want to make our single currency, the euro, fit for the future. Our vision is to create a single European payment solution that is state of the art in terms of technology, enables innovation, makes Europe more independent and resilient, and is trustworthy. In the current project phase, we are preparing to be able to issue the digital euro in the course of 2029. We assume that the legal framework for the digital euro will be in place by the end of this year. This legal basis is a prerequisite for the Eurosystem to be able to start issuing the digital euro. We are working closely with policymakers and banks. They will be a crucial interface between users of the digital euro and the Eurosystem as its issuer. We are already in close dialogue with the general public and, through many events across the country, are clarifying what the digital euro is and what it is not – what benefits it will offer and how data protection and security will be ensured, for instance. According to a Forsa survey conducted on behalf of the Bundesbank, only 42 % of survey participants had heard or read about the digital euro in October 2025. And only just over one-quarter of them knew what it is: an additional digital means of payment issued by the Eurosystem. This shows that we have a considerable amount of work to do to educate the general public. 2 The benefits of the digital euro The digital euro will enable cashless payments to be made simply, securely and across borders throughout the euro area. The digital euro will be just as trustworthy as our banknotes and coins. It is intended to be a digital supplement, a digital ""twin"" to euro cash, and not a substitute. You would be able to use it just as easily as your girocard and existing payment apps on your smartphone – be it at a point of sale, in a restaurant, when shopping online or for credit transfers to friends. And it will also be able to be used offline. No other means of payment apart from the digital euro offers all these features at once in the euro area. The digital euro also presents an opportunity to overcome the strong fragmentation of the European payments market. At present, there is no European payment solution that is accepted in all euro area countries – except for cash. Instead, non-European providers, particularly from the United States, dominate the market. These providers often charge retailers high fees, which we as consumers ultimately pay, too. I'm sure you are familiar with the film ""Pretty Woman"". Then you might remember the quote ""Stores are never nice to people, they're nice to credit cards"". The truth, however, is that while retailers accept credit cards and online payment services, they often do so only reluctantly because of the high fees. By contrast, the digital euro will be a cost-effective alternative to existing digital means of payment for retailers. This is another reason why the retail sector is very open to the digital euro. After all, it will stimulate competition in the payment market. Critics, on the other hand, complain that this would cut the ground from under the feet of private sector initiatives for a European payment solution. But, the opposite is true: private sector solutions such as Wero could benefit from the pan-European reach of the digital euro, for example by integrating the digital euro into the Wero wallet. On the flip side, Wero could be an important means by which people use the digital euro – a win-win situation! I am also convinced that the market offers sufficient space for private and public sector providers. This is because consumers also appreciate the possibility of being able to choose between different options. The digital euro is also being designed to enable future innovations and functions. I am thinking, for instance, of conditional payments: a parcel only being paid for when the customer receives it, to name one example, or a travel refund being issued automatically if a train is delayed, to name another. Launching the digital euro also means we are increasing our strategic autonomy – something which is unfortunately desperately needed in view of geopolitical developments. Visa and Mastercard currently account for almost two-thirds of all card payments in the euro area. 13 out of 21 euro area countries do not have an own national card system like we have girocard in Germany. These countries therefore rely entirely on non-European card systems, including within their own country's borders. To put it bluntly, we are very dependent on US corporations in payments today – too dependent. Payments are part of our critical infrastructure. And we really ought to stand on our own two feet when it comes to critical infrastructure. The digital euro would be the first and only digital means of payment built on a European infrastructure that could be used seamlessly throughout the euro area. And what about data protection? To protect your data, we are designing the digital euro to offer the highest degree of privacy possible for an electronic means of payment. Privacy has been a top priority of the digital euro project since its inception. The Eurosystem central banks will not be able to tell who is behind individual payments. We certainly will not be able to and do not want to control what the public pay for with the digital euro. And those who use the digital euro offline will pay almost as anonymously as they do with cash. Many people are not even aware of how much data they share when paying using other digital means of payment. For some people it does not matter. However, we know from surveys that protecting privacy is a crucial factor for many consumers. According to the Forsa survey I mentioned earlier, it would represent the most important feature for 74 % of respondents. 3 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the digital euro will be a success. It is up to us to bring the euro to where a great future lies ahead of it: the digital world. The digital euro stands for payments that are simple, secure and European – open to innovation, regardless of external factors, and trustworthy for all. We want to develop the digital euro together with consumers, banks, retailers and policymakers. It is neither a project opposing cash, nor a project opposing private sector providers. It is a project of progress for our continent's population. The digital euro is an opportunity for Europe. Thank you for listening.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good morning, and thank you for the invitation to join you today. 1 It is a pleasure to be with you for the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking's 161st Assembly for Bank Directors. Before we get started on the fireside chat, since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, I think it would be helpful to summarize my views on the recent policy decision. I will then offer some remarks on the economy and also share my perspective on the outlook for monetary policy. As we enter 2026, the economy has continued to grow, and I see inflation moving closer to our goal. But beneath the surface, the labor market is fragile. I will provide some perspective on why I think that fragility poses the greater risk and what that means for the path of policy. Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting At our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Let me explain why I agreed to support this decision. I continue to see policy as moderately restrictive, and, looking ahead to 2026, my Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year. In my mind, the question at this meeting was about the timeline for implementing these cuts, essentially choosing between continuing to remove policy restraint and arriving at my estimate of neutral by the April meeting, or moving policy to neutral at a more measured pace throughout this year. I do not consider downside risks to the employment side of our mandate to have diminished, and I see several indications that the labor market remains vulnerable. I could have voted in favor of continuing to remove policy restraint in order to hedge more against the risk of further labor market deterioration. But we have seen some signs of stabilization, and, after lowering the policy rate by a total of 75 basis points in the latter part of last year, in my view, we can afford to take time and ""keep policy powder dry"" for a little while in order to carefully assess how the lower degree of policy restraint is flowing through to broader financial conditions and strengthening the labor market. I am also reluctant to take meaningful signal from the latest data releases given the statistical noise introduced by the government shutdown. And, given that by the time of our March meeting we will have received two additional inflation and employment reports, I saw merit in waiting to take action. It was not a straightforward decision. Ultimately, also considering that inflation remains somewhat elevated, at this meeting I decided to lean in favor of waiting for the upcoming sequence of data releases in order to gain more certainty about how the economy is likely to evolve in the coming months. Current Economic Conditions Since I presented a detailed assessment of economic conditions in a speech two weeks ago, today I will mention a few highlights and some new data points. 2 As the flow of official economic reports has been normalizing, my views on the economy have not changed appreciably, in part because I am not taking much signal from the employment and prices data given increased measurement challenges in the wake of the government shutdown. The U.S. economy has been resilient and has continued to expand at a solid pace, but I remain concerned about fragility in the labor market. I am also confident that inflation will come down toward 2 percent as tariff effects on goods inflation continue to wane in coming months. GDP growth strengthened in the third quarter of last year as consumer spending accelerated. However, growth likely slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the government shutdown and softer momentum in consumer spending, consistent with recent weakness in personal income. Disappointingly, residential investment seems on track to decline again in the fourth quarter. Labor Market Conditions Turning to the labor market, we have seen conditions gradually weaken over the past year, as unemployment rose and payroll employment flattened out. Private payroll employment growth slowed further to about 30,000 per month in the fourth quarter, and weekly ADP data show job gains remaining at a similarly subdued pace through early January, well below earlier last year and below the level necessary to keep unemployment stable. Although the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4 percent in December and has moved sideways in recent months, it has increased by 1/4 percentage point since the middle of last year. Moreover, the Conference Board job availability index dropped sharply in January to its lowest value since early 2021, suggesting that the unemployment rate could move back up in the first quarter. The labor market has become increasingly fragile over the past year and could continue to deteriorate in the near term. Despite some tentative signs of the unemployment rate leveling off, it seems too early to say that the labor market has stabilized, especially with the added statistical noise from the government shutdown and the sharp drop in the CPS survey response rate to below the pandemic lows. Job gains have been concentrated in just a few nonbusiness service industries that are less cyclically sensitive, with health care accounting for all private job gains last quarter. With a less dynamic low-hiring, low-firing labor market, which some have said is giving rise to a ""jobless expansion,"" we could see layoffs rise quickly if firms begin to reassess their staffing needs in response to weaker activity. Although initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low, private job cut announcements increased considerably last year, and there has been news of significant additional layoffs in January, as we heard this week from two large employers. Inflation Developments On inflation, we have seen considerable progress in lowering the underlying trend, considering that still-elevated inflation mostly reflects tariff effects on goods prices that I expect will fade this year. After removing these effects, core PCE inflation would have hovered close to 2 percent in recent months. The underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently showing in the data. Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12-month core PCE inflation likely stood at or a little below 3 percent in December, up somewhat since September. However, the Dallas and Cleveland Fed trimmed-mean measures of PCE and CPI price indexes suggest that 12-month core inflation has continued to decline. The discrepancy between these alternative measures of core inflation seems to reflect increased volatility in the recent data, with unusually large price increases in small categories, like software and video streaming, largely explaining the pickup in the core PCE inflation measure since September. Outlook for the Economy Looking ahead, my baseline expectation is that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace and the labor market will stabilize near full employment as monetary policy moves closer to a neutral setting. Less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more favorable business environment will continue to boost supply-largely due to higher productivity-and more than offset any negative effects on economic activity and inflation from other policies. I expect that the supply-side policies that I just mentioned, along with strength in AI-related investment, will continue to boost productivity gains and help ensure that inflation remains on a downward path. The Path Forward On the outlook for monetary policy, with inflation close to 2 percent, after excluding one-off tariff effects, and with unemployment near estimates of its natural rate but at risk of deteriorating, I continue to see policy as moderately restrictive. Downside risks to the labor market have not diminished, and we should not overemphasize the latest reading on the unemployment rate. I appreciated and supported the language in the post-meeting statement about the recent data, which reflects an appropriate characterization of the unemployment data as showing ""some signs of stabilization."" 3 It will take time to get a clear signal about stability in the labor market. My view is that we should continue to focus on downside risks to our employment mandate, and the description of the labor market is helpful to communicate that we are not overly confident. History tells us that the labor market can appear to be stable right up until it isn't. As I think about the upcoming data, I am aware that first-quarter data tend to be more volatile. Therefore, in my view, we should not rely on these data as a reason to delay policy action if we see a sudden and significant deterioration in labor market conditions. We should also not immediately react if we see inflation go up in January, which has been common in recent years and could reflect residual seasonality or additional statistical noise from the government shutdown and ongoing measurement challenges. I recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may be concerned that inflation remains somewhat elevated and that we have not achieved our inflation goal for some time. However, absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should be ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral. We should also not imply that we expect to maintain the current stance of policy for an extended period of time because it would signal that we are not attentive to the risk that labor market conditions could deteriorate. At the same time, it is important to remember that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will evaluate incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to our dual-mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to inform my assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of policy. Closing Thoughts As the economy continues to evolve, policy must evolve with it. My focus will remain on acting early enough to preserve both price stability and a strong labor market. Thank you again for the invitation to share my views with you today. It is a pleasure to join you. 1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 See Michelle W.

In its report, Moody's stated that Indonesia's rating is affirmed at Baa2 reflecting its strong economic resilience, reflected in stable and solid economic growth, and supported by structural strengths such as natural resources endowments and favorable demographics, which support the medium-term growth outlook. Indonesia's rating affirmation is also supported by the credibility of monetary policy and fiscal prudence, which supports macroeconomic and financial system stability. Meanwhile, the revised outlook is influenced by Moody's view of the risk of a decline in policy predictability, which if continued could have implications for economic performance. Moody's affirmed the Sovereign Credit Rating of the Republic of Indonesia at Baa2 and revised the outlook to negative, as announced on 5 February 2026. Responding to Moody's decision, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo stated, “The outlook adjustment does not reflect any weakening in Indonesia's economic fundamentals. Despite elevated global uncertainty, the domestic economy remains resilient. Economic growth reached 5.39% in the fourth quarter of 2025, bringing full-year growth to 5.1%. Inflation was maintained at 2.92% in 2025, within the target range, while Rupiah exchange rate stability continues to be strengthened through Bank Indonesia's strong policy commitment. Financial system stability also remains well preserved, supported by ample liquidity, strong bank capital, and low credit risk. Moreover, the continued expansion of digital payment systems—underpinned by reliable infrastructure and a sound industry structure—has further reinforced stability and supported economic growth."" Moody's projects that Indonesia's economic growth will remain in the range of 5% in the short to medium term, with economic resilience maintained. Moody's assesses that the fiscal deficit is expected to remain below 3% of GDP, while monetary policy is seen to continue to support inflation stability. Moody's also predicts that the government's debt-to-GDP ratio will remain low below peers. Nevertheless, according to Moody's, Indonesia still faces the challenge of increasing its revenue base, which is needed to drive economic growth while maintaining macro and financial stability. In this regard, Moody's appreciates the Government's efforts to boost revenue, among others, through improving the efficiency of tax and customs administration. Going forward, Bank Indonesia forecasts that Indonesia's economic growth prospects in the medium term will remain solid with an upward trend, supported by maintained inflation. Economic growth in 2026 is projected to increase within the range of 4.9–5.7%, underpinned by stronger domestic demand in line with various Government policies and the continued positive impact of Bank Indonesia's policy mix. This positive performance is predicted to continue to increase in 2027, with projected economic growth in the range of 5.1-5.9%, as well as inflation that will remain maintained. The external resilience of the Indonesian economy also remains strong amid global uncertainty. Indonesia's Balance of Payments (BOP) was maintained solid, driven by a positive trade balance. The trade balance in December 2025 recorded a surplus of 2.51 billion US dollars, supported by non-oil and gas exports based on natural resources and manufacturing. Indonesia's foreign exchange reserve position at the end of December 2025 increased to 156.5 billion US dollars, equivalent to financing 6.4 months of imports or 6.3 months of imports and repayment of the Government's external debt, and above the international adequacy standard of around 3 months of imports. The BOP in 2026 is expected to remain solid with the current account deficit remaining low in the range of deficits 0.9-0.1% of GDP. The rupiah exchange rate is projected to remain stable with a strengthening trend, supported by attractive yields, low inflation, and Indonesia's solid economic growth prospects, as well as Bank Indonesia's commitment to maintaining rupiah stability. Financial system stability is also maintained, supported by ample bank liquidity, high capital, and low credit risk. Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen its policy mix to maintain macroeconomic and financial system stability while promoting sustainable economic growth amid heightened global uncertainty. These efforts will be carried out in close synergy with the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) and in support of the Government's Asta Cita Program and continue to coordinate with the Government to strengthen policy communication to maintain market confidence.

I am delighted to be here for the first time. It is a privilege to join you today. We meet at a moment of profound global transformation. Geopolitical tensions are rising, trade and financial flows are being re-wired, supply chains reconfigured, and energy systems reimagined. All this when technology is advancing at remarkable speed, in particular the role of AI. So, it is no surprise that uncertainty remains elevated and is likely to be the new normal. It is precisely at such moments that cooperation is needed the most. And this is what I’d like to speak to you about today. North Africa has a significant opportunity—an opportunity to deepen its cooperation, trade and integration with sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, and to offer greater growth and prosperity for its people. Of course, the region already has a history of such economic links with trade routes and investment flows with Europe—and more recently, greater engagement with its southern neighbors. The signing of Africa’s continental free trade agreement is just such an example. It holds the promise of becoming one of the drivers of integration across the continent, with benefits not only for its own people but also for Europe. My message to you is this: supercharge this integration. Today, Europe is looking to expand its trade partnerships. Sub-Saharan Africa is looking for avenues to tap the potential of its vast resources and people. And North Africa offers numerous opportunities for investment and partnership. Think of manufacturing hubs that source raw materials or intermediate goods from sub-Saharan Africa. Or, joint infrastructure projects—such as cross-regional railways or digital connectivity platforms. These could unlock economies of scale and improve logistical efficiency across the continent. Energy is another powerful example. With abundant solar and wind resources, North Africa can power industries at home and abroad—supporting Europe’s energy transition, alleviating Africa’s electricity gaps, and accelerating technology transfer across regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa still today 600 million people lack access to electricity—something that the rest of us simply cannot imagine living without. Algeria, in fact, is showing the way with its dual energy advantage—by advancing hybrid solar‑gas projects in the Sahara, expanding power interconnections with Europe, and investing in green hydrogen for export. So, how should policymakers supercharge this integration? First, reduce barriers to trade. Average North African import tariffs standing at 7 percent are higher than those in many ASEAN, GCC, EU and sub-Saharan Africa economies. While Europe accounts for most of North Africa’s trade, trade between North and sub-Saharan Africa is negligible, representing only 4 percent of exports and just 1 percent of imports. We can do more. Second, implement reforms that strengthen the trade and business environment. Efficient trade logistics, a predictable business and regulatory environment, strong governance—these are all essential for investment and exports. For example, modernizing ports and customs systems, and investing in cross-border corridors like the Trans-Maghreb and Cairo–Dakar highways—can dramatically improve connectivity and competitiveness. For new engines of growth to flourish, the region must become a hub where goods, services and capital flow more freely and businesses thrive. Finally, focus on people, the backbone of any economy. North Africa already possesses strong human capital, but there is an opportunity to take that to the next level. Investments in technical and vocational education, enhancing workforce skills including in AI, investments in health – these can all support inclusive, productivity-driven growth. The potential benefits of these reforms are significant. In a new IMF report we published today, we show that a comprehensive package of reforms that increase North Africa’s economic linkages with Europe and sub-Saharan Africa could boost the level of North Africa’s exports by 16 percent and GDP by over 7 percent—increasing economic output by 67 billion dollars. There would also be meaningful benefits for both sub-Saharan Africa and Europe through greater supply-chain participation and investment, and greater resilience and growth in neighboring regions. Let me conclude. When I was preparing for this conference, I learned this Arabic saying: “El yed el wahda ma tsaffeq”—which translates as one hand does not clap. It is a fitting metaphor for our task. Because in times of sweeping transformations, cooperation is not optional, it is essential. That is why I am so pleased to see participants from across North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Europe here today to discuss ways to supercharge their integration and collaboration. From Algiers to Alexandria and Lagos to Lisbon. Working together, we can bring prosperity and opportunity to millions of people. Thank you.",html,2026-02-06 02:49:32,FALSE,False,Skipped (Keyword),False,Skipped (Keyword)

The authorities have consented to the publication of the Staff Report prepared for this consultation.","February 6, 2026 Washington, DC: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas[1] and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting, on a lapse-of-time basis. The authorities have consented to the publication of the Staff Report prepared for this consultation.[2] The Bahamian economy has strengthened in recent years, with real GDP expanding by 3.4 percent in 2024. Growth remained resilient in the first half of 2025, supported by construction and cruise tourism, and the unemployment rate stood at 9.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025. Inflation has decelerated (1.3 percent in July 2025), partly reflecting lower global energy prices. The fiscal position continued to improve in the last fiscal year. Driven by tax revenues and expenditure containment, the primary balance remained in surplus and the fiscal deficit narrowed to 0.5 percent of GDP in FY2024/25. Central government debt has declined but is still elevated, at around 74 percent of GDP. Growth is expected to be around 2.8 percent in 2025, and then it would gradually slow toward 1½ percent (the assessed potential growth rate of the economy). Headline inflation is projected to settle at around 2 percent, and the current account deficit would narrow to about 6 percent of GDP over the medium term. Risks to the outlook are balanced, with downside risks including a potential global slowdown with adverse impact on tourism, and natural disasters. Upside risks notably include greater-than-expected effects of public and private infrastructure projects linked to tourism and the energy sector reform. Executive Board Assessment[3] In concluding the 2025 Article IV consultation with The Bahamas, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows: “The economy has strengthened in recent years. Robust post-pandemic tourism has been a key driver of economic growth and fiscal revenues. Actions have been taken to improve public finances and to enhance disaster risk management. Continued fiscal consolidation, the ongoing electricity sector reform, increased capacity for tourism, and investment in climate resilience will be critical to further reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and foster sustained growth. “Growth is expected to moderate gradually. Growth in 2025 has been supported by construction and cruise tourism, but the economic expansion is expected to slow somewhat in 2026, converging toward the estimated potential rate of 1½ percent over the medium term. Risks are broadly balanced, with downside risks including a potential global slowdown and natural disasters, and upside risks entailing greater-than-expected effects of public and private infrastructure projects linked to tourism and the electricity reform. Inflation remains low. “Additional policy measures are necessary to achieve the authorities’ medium-term target for central government debt. A primary surplus was reached again in FY2024/25, and the FY2025/26 budget targets an overall surplus. While declining, public debt remains elevated. Going forward, new revenue-enhancing and expenditure-optimizing measures should be prioritized to achieve the authorities’ 50 percent of GDP target for central government debt. These measures can include introducing corporate and personal income taxes, rationalizing tax expenditures, raising the standard VAT rate, and reducing transfers to SOEs. These efforts can give space to invest more in priority areas, such as education and resilient infrastructure. “More work is needed to strengthen fiscal institutions and reduce fiscal risks. An immediate priority should be to improve fiscal reporting and enhance the institutional framework for PPPs. It is also critical to accurately assess and mitigate fiscal risks arising from SOEs. The planned reform to civil service pensions should be supplemented with more holistic changes to address actuarial imbalances. Advancing plans to adopt an accrual-based accounting system for the budget would improve fiscal transparency. Efforts to reduce debt rollover risks should continue. “Financial sector policies should continue to aim at preserving financial stability. Systemic financial stability risks remain moderate. As bank credit to the private sector increases, safeguarding banks’ resilience is crucial, including by monitoring potential risks stemming from banks’ exposure to the sovereign. The oversight of nonbanks should be strengthened, and closing data gaps is a priority. Operationalizing real estate price indices is still needed. Planned legal reforms can help improve resolution frameworks and safety nets. Reducing the ceiling on central bank advances to the government would support the exchange rate peg, and it is essential to maintain efforts to implement the 2024 DARE Act. Actions to enhance risk-based AML/CFT supervision and promote financial inclusion should continue. “Fostering economic resilience and investing in human and physical capital should ease supply-side constraints to growth. Policies to raise productivity, together with fiscal consolidation, can help narrow external imbalances, given that the external position is moderately weaker than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Ongoing infrastructure projects in hotels and airports can alleviate capacity constraints in tourism. To reduce vulnerable employment and lessen informality, it is important to cut red tape for businesses, strengthen education, and continue expanding training and upskilling opportunities. Trade diversification could strengthen economic resilience and reduce import costs (with more benefits for consumers if coupled with greater product market competition). The energy sector reform is advancing and may significantly improve the cost and reliability of electricity. There is scope to continue enhancing disaster risk management and investing in climate resilience. To address housing affordability challenges, investing in social housing and refining rental market regulations could help ease supply constraints.” Table 1.

Missions are undertaken as part of regular (usually annual) consultations under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, in the context of a request to use IMF resources (borrow from the IMF), as part of discussions of staff monitored programs, or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments. Jerusalem, Israel: Israel’s economy has demonstrated notable resilience. Following the Gaza ceasefire, economic activity accelerated markedly, and staff expect growth to firm in the near term. But there are downside risks, including from potential renewed regional tensions. The conflict’s legacy is substantial: defense spending remains elevated, risk premia are higher, and labor supply is constrained by extended military mobilization and reduced availability of non-Israeli workers. These pressures would compound longstanding structural challenges—such as persistently low labor market participation among specific groups—and weigh on the medium-term economic outlook. Economic outlook and risks Restoring fiscal buffers amid higher defense spending Advancing the longstanding structural reform agenda Ensuring price and financial stability, and strengthening financial integrity The mission thanks the authorities and private sector counterparts for their warm hospitality and candid and high-quality discussions. The IMF team is especially grateful to the Bank of Israel for its assistance with meeting and logistical arrangements.

The regulator summed up the results of the first MPR in 2023. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of monetary policy taking into account the evolution of macroeconomic conditions. The Bank of Russia plans to carry out analytical work and public discussions in 2026–2027 and summarise MPR findings by mid-2028. The analysis will comprise six work streams, specifically ‘Inflation target format’, ‘Operational framework of monetary policy’, ‘Retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of monetary policy’, ‘Communication as a monetary policy instrument’, ‘Interaction of monetary policy and other economic policies’, and ‘Long-term trends and monetary policy’. The Bank of Russia encourages leading experts, researchers, and analysts to join the analysis of monetary policy within these work streams. In the middle of 2027, the regulator plans a scientific conference to discuss the results of studies conducted by both Bank of Russia specialists and external experts. In the course of MPR 2028, the Bank of Russia will carry out meetings with representatives of businesses, public organisations, government authorities and the academic and expert community, professional financial market participants, and citizens.
