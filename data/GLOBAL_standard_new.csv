The Scale-up Unit announced last year is designed to build stronger ties and provide tailored support for fast-growing and innovative financial firms, helping them to grow sustainably at pace. The six firms that expressed interest and have been accepted to the first cohort are: Allica Bank ClearBank Monument Bank Nottingham Building Society OakNorth Bank Zopa Bank These firms will receive support designed to help them navigate the regulatory landscape as they develop new products, attract new customers, and move into new markets. PRA and FCA officials will meet directly with the firms, both as a group and individually, throughout the coming months. This will also help the PRA and FCA better understand scaling firms’ experience of the regulatory process, with the aim of improving regulatory processes for the entire sector to help firms expand and innovate. Charlotte Gerken, Executive Director for UK Deposit Takers at the PRA, said: “Welcoming the first cohort to our Scale-up Unit is an important milestone. It shows our commitment to helping firms grow in a sustainable way that benefits the financial services sector and wider economic growth.” Jessica Rusu, Chief Data, Information and Intelligence Officer at the FCA said: “We look forward to working with the first cohort as we deliver on our strategy to support growth and UK competitiveness. Our joint Scale-Up Unit enhances the support available to firms as they move from start-up to scale up, helping them to grow successfully and sustainably.” The regulators will be open to expressions of interest from a second cohort of firms later this year, with further detail to follow. The Scale-up Unit is also open to requests for support from smaller, fast-growing insurers on an ongoing basis, rather than through a cohort, in line with the criteria set out on the PRA website. The FCA currently supports new and high growth firms through its Early and High Growth Oversight function. They will further enhance their offer by opening expressions of interest for a new solo regulated Scale up cohort in the Spring, supporting firms from a wider range of sectors. Richard Davies, CEO of Allica Bank, said: “Allica are delighted to be included in the initial Scale-up Unit cohort, having led the call for a dedicated regulatory unit to support firms as they scale. The Unit should provide banks like Allica with more capital certainty and more regulatory support to boost lending to the established SMEs that power the UK’s real economy. “Done well, the Scale-up Unit can support the government’s objective to make the UK the location of choice for financial services firms to invest, innovate and grow.” Rishi Khosla, CEO and Co-founder of OakNorth, said: “We’re honoured to be part of the first cohort of the Scale-up Unit. OakNorth was founded to empower breakthrough businesses – profitable and scaling lower-mid-market companies – who are too often overlooked by traditional banks, and this tailored regulatory support will help us better deliver on that mission as we continue to scale. “Having already lent over $21bn to these businesses, supporting the creation of tens of thousands of jobs and homes, we’re delighted to work closely with regulators to build an even stronger platform for sustainable growth.” Notes to editors The Scale-up Unit The Scale-up Unit builds on and complements the regulators’ existing support for early-stage firms, including through the New Bank and Insurer Start-up Units, Regulatory Sandbox, Early and High Growth Oversight function, Pre Application Support Service (PASS), and AI Lab. It recognises the different types of support needed for firms at the next stage of their development. The Scale-up Unit also aligns with changes designed to streamline regulation, including implementing Basel 3.1, Solvency UK, Strong and Simple, and reforms to the Senior Managers Regime. It also aligns with the Office for Investment: Financial Services, which is helping foreign firms enter and adjust to the UK market. Other news Regulators announce first firms to join Scale-up...

While inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it picked up materially in the second half of 2025. The Board has been closely monitoring the economy and judges that some of the increase in inflation reflects greater capacity pressures. As a result, the Board considers that inflation is likely to remain above target for some time. Capacity pressures reflect, in part, the greater momentum in demand seen in recent months. Growth in private demand has strengthened substantially more than expected, driven by both household spending and investment. Activity and prices in the housing market are also continuing to pick up. Financial conditions eased over 2025 and it is uncertain whether they remain restrictive. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses and the effects of earlier interest rate reductions are yet to flow through fully to aggregate demand, prices and wages. More recently, the exchange rate, money market interest rates and government bond yields have risen following a rise in market expectations for the cash rate. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight and that they have stabilised in recent months, in line with the pick-up in momentum in economic activity. The unemployment rate has been a little lower than expected and measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates. Growth in the Wage Price Index has eased from its peak, but broader measures of wages growth continue to be strong and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation and the extent to which monetary policy is restrictive. On the domestic side, if growth in demand is stronger than expected, and growth in the economy’s supply capacity remains limited, it is likely to add further to capacity pressures. Uncertainty in the global economy remains significant but so far there has been little or no depressing effect on the Australian economy; indeed, recent growth and trade in Australia’s major trading partners has surprised on the upside. Decision A wide range of data over recent months have confirmed that inflationary pressures picked up materially in the second half of 2025. While part of the pick-up in inflation is assessed to reflect temporary factors, it is evident that private demand is growing more quickly than expected, capacity pressures are greater than previously assessed and labour market conditions are a little tight. The Board judged that inflation is likely to remain above target for some time and it was appropriate to increase the cash rate target. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Introduction Good evening, everyone, and happy new year to all. I always appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Council on Foreign Relations. 1 I'm looking forward to a robust discussion this evening. You may have read that the words of the year for 2025 were phrases like ""rage-bait,"" ""AI slop,"" and, of course, ""6-7."" I'd add a word of my own. In December, I gave a speech titled ""Resilience."" 2 I said then that despite all the uncertainty posed by trade policy and geopolitical events, the U.S. and global economies showed considerable resilience, continued to grow, and were poised to gain steam in 2026. I'd like to pick up where I left off and talk about what I expect to see this year for the U.S. economy and for monetary policy. Before I continue, allow me to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System. 2026 at a Glance Let me begin by sharing a snapshot of the current state of the economy. While we haven't had the normal flow of official data in recent months due to the government shutdown, these data are now slowly coming in. And many other alternative indicators have augmented the overall picture. Based on the totality of the data, the economic outlook is favorable. GDP growth looks to have been somewhat above 2 percent last year, and it will likely pick up some this year. Although the labor market cooled over the past couple of years, I expect that we'll see it stabilize this year and then strengthen somewhat thereafter. Inflation appears likely to peak sometime in the first half of this year as the full effects of tariffs are felt and then will be poised to move back toward the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal. Clearer View Since I mentioned often used words in 2025, allow me to dive further into a discussion of another word that defined the year: tariffs. As trade policy has evolved and details have become clearer in recent months, estimates of effective tariff rates today are considerably lower than they were last spring. At the same time, the data are providing a clearer picture of the likely effects of tariffs on inflation. Based on granular analysis of the data in hand, we can draw a few conclusions. First, the tariffs have been overwhelmingly borne by domestic businesses and consumers, rather than by foreign producers. Second, the tariffs have already meaningfully increased U.S. prices of imported goods, although the full effects have likely not yet been felt. My current estimate is that the increase in tariffs to date has contributed around one half of a percentage point to the current inflation rate of about 2-3/4 percent. Tariffs aside, underlying inflation trends have been pretty favorable, and we're seeing no signs of broader inflationary pressures. In particular, shelter inflation has continued to decline steadily, no significant supply chain bottlenecks have emerged, and measures of wage growth have moved to levels consistent with low inflation. In addition, inflation expectations remain well anchored. The New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) shows that although short-term expectations have moved up somewhat, medium- and longer-term expectations remain well within their pre-Covid ranges. 3 Most other measures of longer-run inflation expectations tell the same story. This is something I watch closely, because well-anchored expectations are critical to ensuring low and stable inflation. Cooling Labor Market When it comes to employment, the labor market continued to cool during 2025, with labor demand not keeping up with supply. Over the course of last year, the unemployment rate moved up, and ended the year at 4.4 percent. Other survey-based measures of the balance between demand and supply-including from the Conference Board and the National Federation of Independent Business, as well as the New York Fed's SCE-also show increasing slack in the labor market. Many of these labor market indicators are now at levels we saw in the years prior to the pandemic, a time when the labor market was not overheated and inflation was quite low. And although the labor market has clearly cooled, I should emphasize that this has been a gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration. International Similarities We're seeing broadly similar patterns of resilience in many economies around the world, which likewise have navigated the effects of U.S. trade policy uncertainty reasonably well. Because most other countries have not instituted reciprocal tariffs, they have not experienced increased import prices in the same way as in the U.S. Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook With this in mind, I'll now explain how monetary policy is positioned for this year and beyond. I'll also share my outlook for the U.S. economy. It is imperative that we restore inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis. It is equally important to do so without creating undue risks to the Federal Reserve's maximum employment goal. In recent months, the downside risks to employment have increased as the labor market cooled, while the upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat for the reasons that I have already discussed. The actions taken by the FOMC in the latter part of last year have brought these risks into better balance. By reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by a cumulative 75 basis points last year, the FOMC has moved the modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy closer to neutral. Monetary policy is now well positioned to support the stabilization of the labor market and the return of inflation to the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent. My base case for the economic outlook is quite favorable. Looking ahead, I expect tariffs will have a largely one-off effect on prices that will be fully realized this year. As a result, I anticipate inflation will peak at around 2-3/4 to 3 percent sometime during the first half of this year, before starting to fall back. I expect inflation will be just under 2-1/2 percent for this year as a whole, before reaching the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent goal in 2027. I expect the economy to grow above trend this year, with real GDP growth between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent. This pickup from last year's pace is in part due to a first-quarter rebound from the effects of the government shutdown, but it's also fueled by tailwinds from fiscal policy, favorable financial conditions, and increased investments in artificial intelligence. With my forecast of above-trend GDP growth, I expect the unemployment rate to stabilize this year and then gradually come down over the next few years. Of course, there is always uncertainty when looking into the future, so I'll remain data dependent as the year takes shape. As the December FOMC statement said: ""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."" 4 Balance Sheet Before I close, I'd like to briefly comment on the Fed's balance sheet. The FOMC stopped reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at the start of December. 5 With the level of bank reserves deemed to have reached ample levels, the FOMC decided at its December meeting to initiate reserve management purchases to maintain an ample supply of reserves on an ongoing basis. This is the natural next step in the implementation of our ample reserves framework to ensure effective interest rate control, and it in no way reflects a shift in the stance of monetary policy. 6 With the steady decline in the level of reserves, we have observed upward pressure on repo rates at times in recent months. 7 When this occurs, the Fed's standing repo operations can act as a shock absorber by capping pressures on money market rates resulting from strong liquidity demand or market stress. 8 I fully expect that standing repo operations will continue to be actively used in this way and function exactly as designed. In fact, we just saw this in action over year-end when some of the usual market pressures arose. Conclusion It's only January, so I won't speculate about the word of the year for 2026. But the resilience we have been seeing means the economy is poised for solid growth and a return to price stability. That said, it's important not to forget another word frequently heard in 2025: uncertainty. In assessing the future path of monetary policy, my view, as always, will be based on the evolution of the totality of the data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks to the achievement of our maximum employment and price stability goals.

Lunch Jour Fixe, Berlin, 26 January 2026.","Joachim Nagel: Outlook for 2026 in the light of multifaceted challenges worldwide Speech by Dr Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Ambassadors Club e.V. Lunch Jour Fixe, Berlin, 26 January 2026. The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Check against delivery Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure and an honour to be with you today. In the next few minutes, I would like to give you an overview of the economic outlook for Germany from the Bundesbank's perspective. The outlook is closely intertwined with the major and multifaceted challenges that we are facing around the world. I would therefore also like to talk about how we can approach major challenges. What examples and experiences are available from a central bank perspective? 1 Recent economic outlook for Germany The Bundesbank published its latest forecast for Germany about a month ago, shortly before Christmas. 1 According to the forecast, inflation in Germany will continue its way back to 2 % this year. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany is forecast to grow at a rate of 2.2 % in 2026 and around 2 % in 2027 and 2028. That's very good news for all of us: in Germany – as in the euro area – the inflation rate is back towards 2 %, the level at which we want to see it. If we look at economic activity, German gross domestic product grew slightly in 2025 by 0.3 % in calendar-adjusted terms. It will grow somewhat more strongly, by about 0.6 %, in 2026, by 1.3 % in 2027 and by 1.1 % in 2028. From 2026 onwards, the expansionary fiscal stance will clearly support economic growth in Germany. The cumulative overall effect of additional government spending on defence and infrastructure is estimated to contribute 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth by 2028. Furthermore, transfers and tax cuts are expected to boost the incomes of households and firms. Government deficit and debt ratios will rise significantly. Bundesbank experts expect the debt ratio to increase from 62 % in 2024 to 68 % in 2028. Over the same period, the deficit ratio is expected to increase from 2.7 % to 4.8 %. A robust budget plan is needed that will bring the deficit back down in the medium term without cutting back on the relevant infrastructure investment. When using the extended scope for borrowing for defence and infrastructure, fiscal policy should make sure that this borrowing actually does lead to additional investment. And it must also make sure that public finances remain sound in the future. The Bundesbank has made proposals with a view to both these things. 2 We anticipate that fiscal policy will not be the only contributor to GDP growth in Germany. A revival in household demand will also play an important role over the entire forecast horizon. By contrast, we expect business investment to remain dampened by a difficult investment environment owing to cyclical and structural headwinds. It will return to an expansionary path only slowly and later in 2026. German exports are likely to slowly return to an expansion path over the course of 2026 and contribute to GDP growth. However, they are still suffering from higher tariffs and will gain momentum only moderately – and that is without even factoring in the spectre of a further tariff escalation. There are also structural obstacles weighing on competitiveness. 3 At the same time, German imports will rise considerably. Thus, the German current account surplus – as a share of nominal GDP – will decrease over the forecast horizon, from an expected 4.7 % in 2025 to no more than 3.2 % in 2028. Compared with past decades, these figures are remarkably low. To sum up: the German economy will be gradually returning to a recovery path over the course of 2026. 2 Multifaceted challenges worldwide 2.1 International challenges are omnipresent Ladies and gentlemen, It will come as no surprise to you that the outlook and forecast presented are subject to uncertainty. Economic growth could be weaker, inflation could be higher. We are currently facing a broad array of different challenges worldwide. Let me name a few. International trade disputes and geopolitical conflicts shaped developments last year. They played a big part in pushing up uncertainty. It had an impact on cross-border trade relations and exchange rate developments, amongst other things. And unfortunately, as things stand, caution requires us to assume that both geopolitical conflicts and trade disputes are here to stay. Regardless of whether the demands of one NATO member on an ally's territory are withdrawn or not. And there are other challenges, too. We are all witnessing the continued rapid rise of artificial intelligence as it becomes more and more important. The new technology entails great opportunities, but also risks. Digital innovation is also set to revamp the financial system as we have known it. The distributed ledger technology in particular has not only spawned new types of assets. It also challenges the business models of many existing players, promising both gains in efficiency and creating new risks. And of course, climate change and its impact is a challenge for countries and people all over the world. These are four very different examples of challenges all our economies are facing, and the full list of challenges is indeed much longer than this. So we need to ask ourselves: how can we find suitable answers, how can we react, how can we address uncertainty? 2.2 Experience in dealing with international challenges Ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank I have found it always to be worthwhile to look at what has worked before when it comes to dealing with international challenges, and to leverage the experiences gained. First: I firmly believe that global challenges should be dealt with through rules-based international cooperation. Second: we have tried-and-tested institutions and forums for international cooperation. We should make use of them! At present, one gets the impression that ""might is right"". Rules and international cooperation appear to have fallen out of fashion. But blackmail and violence are not the basis for lasting cooperation. Long-term cooperation is made possible through understanding, reliability and compliance with shared rules. Let us remember the financial crisis that started in 2007 in the United States. Cross-border joint work at the international and the European level has since done a lot to make the financial system more resilient. In response to the global financial crisis, the G20 created the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which is based at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The G20 mandated the FSB to deliver the reform agenda and it translates political commitments into international standards. Today it plays a vital role in safeguarding global financial stability by strengthening the resilience of the global financial system. The Bank for International Settlements itself was founded in 1930. That makes it the world's oldest international financial organisation. It plays a key role in the cooperation of central banks and other financial institutions. Another important example: the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It promotes global financial stability and monetary cooperation among the countries in the international monetary system. During the global financial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis, the IMF proved its role as a stabilising anchor by providing financial support, policy guidance and credibility, when it was most needed. And, as a more recent example, the Fund again stepped up its engagement during the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent energy and inflation shocks. It swiftly provided policy advice and extensive financial assistance to many of its members with a view to restoring stability. Alongside these institutions, the G7 and the G20 have served as essential informal forums for dialogue and coordination for many years. I describe these experiences of international cooperation because they are examples of how to deal best with cross-border challenges. Disruptions in the financial system can cause considerable real economic and social costs. Central banks play a key role in preventing and managing such disruptions. And we at the Bundesbank work on a regular basis with all these institutions I have just spoken about, actively contributing in various forums. Our enthusiasm is driven by our unshakable conviction that a world shaped by cooperation is better than a world of confrontation. This also holds for another challenge I mentioned: the rise of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence. To illustrate what cooperation on new technologies can look like, let me draw your attention to the Innovation Hub operated by the Bank for International Settlements. The Hub has innovation centres in various locations worldwide. One such innovation centre for all Eurosystem central banks is jointly located at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main and the Banque de France in Paris. The aim of the BIS Innovation Hub is to improve the functioning of the global financial system. To this end, key innovations in the financial sector are identified, analysed and also developed for central banks. In addition, the Innovation Hub coordinates a global network of central bank experts, pooling central banks' knowledge and efforts to keep pace with rapid technological developments. Finally, I would like to mention the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The global network of more than 140 central banks and supervisory authorities is committed to a more sustainable financial system. Its aim is to analyse the impact of climate change and nature loss and to strengthen the role of the financial system in financing the transition to a sustainable economy. The NGFS was established in December 2017; the Bundesbank has been serving as chair since 2024. Now you might ask, but what do you do if ""might is right"" seems to be the order of the day? If there is no willingness to cooperate? My answer: we must face up to the facts. International cooperation has become more arduous. Some countries may try to bypass or marginalise international institutions. However, this does not mean we should all simply abandon international cooperation. For those of us who still believe in a rules-based world, one truth stays the same as ever: together we are stronger. We should seek common solutions where this is possible, with whom this is possible. That is the recommendation my former colleague Mark Carney gave in a brilliant speech in Davos five days ago. 4 And I agree with him. 3 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me close with a brief summary. As you will no doubt have noticed, I am proud to be part of a community of central banks that is tackling major challenges together. Experience has shown that this can be very helpful. For the German economy, we at the Bundesbank see sizeable challenges. Germany's recession in 2023 and 2024 is indicator enough. Last year, GDP grew only slightly. And the Bundesbank expects Germany to embark on a slow return to recovery this year. Last March, I outlined economic policies which could help Germany to cope with its challenges. 5 Since then, we have seen first steps in the right direction, but there is still a lot to be done. Speaking in Davos last week, Chancellor Friedrich Merz vividly explained that progress has to be made in four areas simultaneously, and I quote: We must continue supporting Ukraine in its fight for a just peace. We must become capable of defending ourselves on our own in Europe. We want to reduce dependencies that currently make us vulnerable. And fourth, we want to ensure that our economy can tap into its full potential for innovation and growth. 6 One thing is clear: many of today's challenges cannot be tackled by an individual country on its own. Many of these major challenges are global in nature. We are best able to solve them together – by talking and negotiating with each other, in a spirit of cooperation and consensus-seeking, with everybody embracing respectful, rules-based interaction. I have a hunch that's what you ambassadors work to achieve most of the time, too. So I am now looking forward to our discussion and thank you very much for your attention. 1 Deutsche Bundesbank (2025), Forecast for Germany: Economy gradually returns to recovery path , Monthly Report , December 2025. 2 Deutsche Bundesbank (2025), Further development of the debt brake – a Bundesbank contribution to the reform debate , November 2025.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Thank you, Madame Ambassador, for the introduction and thank you also to the Delphi Economic Forum for the opportunity to speak today. My topic is the implications of deregulation for monetary policy, an appropriate one for this setting. Greece's recovery from the crisis that began in 2009 was only possible after the Greek people implemented substantial and painful reforms, including alleviating suffocating over-regulation in many sectors. In addition to the other reforms embraced by Greece, deregulation freed businesses to compete domestically and internationally, and promoted individuals' access to the economy. The range of reforms has included liberalizing product and service markets, easing licensing and administrative burdens, opening previously restricted professions, and increasing labor market flexibility. The government liberalized electricity and gas utilities; privatized airports, ports, and utilities; and reformed bankruptcy procedures and other business laws. While it is challenging to quantify how these deregulatory actions have affected the economy, there is little doubt that these reforms have supported a remarkable return to economic growth and higher living standards. Macroeconomic stability has returned to Greece. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, and investment and exports have rebounded. Product and labor market reforms helped restore competitiveness, reduce unit labor costs, and encourage firm entry. By easing the ability of supply to respond to prices, these reforms have improved the transmission of monetary policy. While monetary policy is set by the ECB, its transmission varies in part with how national governments manage their economies. Long-term Greek borrowing rates narrowed their spread to Germany's, below 1 percent, compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Greece has a come a long way, impressing the whole world with its recovery.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. My dear colleagues at the Bank of Korea, The year 2026 has dawned. I sincerely wish all of you and your families health and peace in the your daily lives. First of all, let me express my sincere gratitude to all of our staff who did their best in their respective roles despite difficult circumstances over the past year, as well as to the members of the Monetary Policy Board for their leadership in conducting monetary policy. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank your families, who have steadfastly supported you behind the scenes. Thanks to your collective dedication, the Bank of Korea was able to endure the past year successfully. Last year, our economy faced numerous challenges and upheavals, making it difficult to see even a short distance ahead. We went through a difficult phase in the first quarter, experiencing negative growth due to the fallout from the unexpected political shock. In April, the global trade environment also deteriorated sharply following the Trump administration's unprecedentedly aggressive tariff measures. Fortunately, as political risks eased following the presidential election in June, growth momentum partially recovered. Nevertheless, the trade conflict surrounding the Korea–United States investment agreement persisted until the APEC Leaders' Meeting at the end of October, which made it difficult to gauge the pace of economic recovery. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Korea was also required to make difficult policy judgments at every moment in conducting monetary policy. Immediately after the declaration of martial law, we focused on instilling confidence at home and abroad that the economic system was operating normally and independently from politics. Subsequently, as growth slowed amid stable inflation, the Bank cut the Base Rate twice during the first half of the year. The Bank also, continued to support vulnerable sectors through the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility. As we moved into the second half of the year, heightened instability in the housing market in the Seoul metropolitan area and increased exchange rate volatility intensified the tension between the two objectives of growth and financial stability. As a result, the Bank decided to keep the Base Rate unchanged. My dear colleagues, This year, the conditions surrounding our economy are also expected to remain challenging. While it may be desirable to deliver a message of hope at the start of a new year, I believe that today's occasion should go beyond a simple New Year's greeting. It should serve as a moment to soberly recognize the realities we face and to reaffirm our responsibilities and resolve as a central bank. Looking at the external conditions this year, a range of risk factors related to the global trade environment and the fiscal policies of major economies remain present. First of all, there is significant uncertainty regarding the global trade landscape and the monetary policies of major countries. On the trade front, risks concerning tariffs and trade policy could resurface depending on how judicial and political developments in the United States unfold. If tensions between the United States and China were to escalate amid discussions on ""global imbalances,"" a key agenda item at this year's G20 meetings, it would be difficult for Korea to remain unaffected. Uncertainty surrounding the investment agreement with the United States cannot yet be considered resolved. Although related risks have eased since the APEC Leaders' Meeting last October, further clarification is still needed with respect to specific investment targets and modalities. In addition, we are well aware of concerns that annual US-bound investment flows of up to USD 20 billion could exert depreciation pressure on the Korean won. However, this figure represents the maximum ceiling. As stipulated in the bilateral MOU, the actual scale of investment will be determined within a range that does not undermine foreign exchange market stability (Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources, 2025). In other words, this does not imply a mechanical annual outflow of USD 20 billion in investment funds to the United States, and the Bank of Korea, together with the government, will ensure that the actual decided-upon investment flow does not compromise foreign exchange market stability. This principle will be firmly upheld without exception. Moreover, there is also a high degree of uncertainty surrounding monetary policy in major economies. One key source of uncertainty relates to the future policy direction of the Federal Reserve and its implications for global financial markets, particularly after the scheduled end of Chair Powell's term in May. In addition, other major economies, including Japan, the euro area, and Australia, have begun policy rate hikes or may potentially shift their policy stances. Such divergences in monetary policy paths across countries could amplify market volatility. Attention should also be paid to the impact of fiscal soundness and government bond market conditions in major economies on domestic and global financial markets. Fiscal conditions have deteriorated markedly due to increased fiscal spending associated with population aging and a rising interest payment burden stemming from elevated government debt accumulated since the COVID-19 pandemic (Bank of Korea, 2025a; IMF, 2025a). Reflecting these developments, global long-term government bond yields have risen substantially. More recently, as the influence of non-bank financial institutions has expanded in repo markets collateralized by government bond, vigilance has increased regarding the risk that vulnerabilities could be amplified in the event of a shock. (Banerjee, R. et al., 2025). As market concerns about fiscal soundness increase and their impacts may differ across countries, we need to closely monitor spillovers to Korean government bond yields. At the same time, we should take the situations faced by other economies as a cautionary lesson and maintain vigilance against the expansion of fiscal and financial risks. Meanwhile, the possibility that expectations for the global AI industry could be revised also represents another key risk factor for financial markets (IMF, 2025b). Recently, amid a rapid rise in the stock prices of AI-related companies, concerns have intensified in the United States that price correction risks could spill over more broadly due to interconnected debt structures among AI firms. Given Korea's competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing, which underpins the AI industry ecosystem, Korea is likely to maintain a relatively high degree of resilience regardless of the outcome of global competition among AI firms. Nevertheless, as domestic investors' exposure to global AI companies has expanded significantly, it has become increasingly important to manage risks in preparation for the possibility of a sharp correction in the US stock market. My dear colleagues, Let me now turn to domestic conditions. First, consumer price inflation has recently risen to the low-to-mid 2% range, reflecting the effects of adverse weather conditions and the rising exchange rate. However, once these temporary factors ease, inflation this year is expected to record 2.1%, the same as last year, as demand pressures remain subdued. Such a trajectory would be more stable than those of major economies. That said, we need to remain mindful that inflationary pressures could intensify again if the elevated level of the exchange rate persists. In addition, there is concern that, as a result of cumulative high inflation since the pandemic, elevated living costs are placing a heavier burden on low-income households. To address these challenges, stabilizing inflation through monetary policy alone will not be sufficient. For items whose prices remain high by international standards, it will also be necessary to pursue structural reforms, including improvements in distribution structures and greater import openness (Im, W. et al., 2024). Turning to growth, the growth rate this year is projected at 1.8%, significantly higher than last year's 1.0%, and close to its potential level. However, this outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty on both the upside and the downside, depending on developments in the global trade environment, the semiconductor cycle, and the pace of the recovery in domestic demand (Bank of Korea, 2025b). Moreover, excluding the IT sector, which is expected to lead growth this year on the back of the global semiconductor upturn, the growth rate would be limited to 1.4%, and, amid widening disparities in the pace of recovery across sectors, a sizable gap is likely to open up between headline indicators and actual economic sentiment. Such a ""K-shaped recovery"" can hardly be regarded as sustainable or complete. As I noted in last year's New Year's speech, it is essential to continue our efforts toward structural reform, including diversifying the growth base by developing new industries, and to prevent a recurrence of growth and recovery patterns that are overly concentrated in specific sectors. Next, I would like to address exchange rate volatility, which has recently become a source of growing concern. At the end of last year, the Korean won–US dollar exchange rate rose to the upper 1,400 won range, and market vigilance remains high. Given that Korea is a net external creditor country with sound external fundamentals, it is not appropriate to view the current situation as comparable to past crisis episodes based solely on the recent level of the exchange rate. However, it is important to remain mindful that a rising exchange rate can add to inflationary pressures and weigh relatively heavily on domestic-oriented firms, thereby exacerbating the polarization discussed earlier. While it is difficult to pin down an appropriate level for the exchange rate, the recent level in the upper 1,400 won range appears to be substantially misaligned with Korea's economic fundamentals. The elevated exchange rate reflects, among other factors, growth and interest rate differentials between Korea and the United States, as well as the so-called ""Korea discount."" Addressing these issues will require, over the medium to long term, strengthening industrial competitiveness and expanding investment incentives through capital market reforms. Meanwhile, the relatively larger depreciation of the won since last October, compared with the US dollar, also reflects persistently rising residents' overseas securities investment, which has created supply-demand imbalances in the foreign exchange market and, in turn, exerted substantial short-term upward pressure on the exchange rate. In response, the foreign exchange authorities found it necessary to implement short-term measures late last year to stabilize the foreign exchange market. In particular, as we look back on the won's depreciation over the past three years, I strongly feel it is necessary to reassess the macroeconomic impact of the National Pension Service's (NPS) overseas investments, which are exerting increasingly greater influence on the foreign exchange market, alongside safeguarding the pension's long-term returns. The scale and timing of the NPS's overseas investments, as well as its foreign exchange hedging strategies, have become overly transparent to domestic and international markets. As a result, expectations of currency depreciation tilted overwhelmingly in one direction, increasing the risk of influencing the investment decisions of other economic agents at home and abroad. In addition, while the investment decisions of economic agents are based on rational judgment under given conditions, the time has come to take a comprehensive look at the broader implications of persistently expanding residents' overseas investment for economic growth and the development of the domestic capital market. If this situation persists without serious reflection and without a coordinated, government-wide framework to address its macroeconomic implications, we could find ourselves in a recurring dilemma. In other words, even amid heightened tensions in the foreign exchange market, the NPS would continue to purchase US dollars according to its preset plans, while the foreign exchange authorities would be compelled to sell dollars. In this process, even if the depreciation of the won boosts the National Pension Service's won-denominated book returns, this does not necessarily represent a long-term increase in the retirement assets of the Korean people. Against this backdrop, it is a meaningful step forward that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has recently launched a task force to allow flexible strategic hedging responses, and that the relevant government ministries, the NPS, and the Bank of Korea have agreed to cooperate and discuss the establishment of a ""New Framework"" for the NPS's overseas investment. We look forward to appropriate improvement measures being put into place in the near future. My dear colleagues of the Bank of Korea, Considering all of these risk factors, just like in the past year, we are likely to be called upon to make difficult policy judgments at every turn this year. This is because there are both upside and downside risks to the growth path, and inflation dynamics could vary depending on exchange rate movements. In addition, from the perspective of financial stability, there is a need to continue to closely monitor developments in housing prices in the Seoul metropolitan area. As uncertainty in the policy environment increases and trade-offs among policy variables intensify, the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy in a more calibrated manner, carefully assessing a wide range of economic indicators. In this process, communication with markets will become even more important. There may be moments when we must face misunderstandings and criticism, but we will make the best possible decisions guided by a strong sense of responsibility. As we actively communicate the direction of monetary policy amid high uncertainty, when this communication diverges from market expectations, interest rate volatility may increase in the short term and criticism from economic agents who incur losses in the process may intensify. However, such volatility is an unavoidable part of narrowing gaps in perceptions between the market and policymakers regarding economic conditions. Rather than seeking to avoid these risks by lagging behind market expectations, it is an essential responsibility of a central bank to explain the direction of monetary policy in a timely manner as policy conditions change. With this in mind, the Bank of Korea will further refine our policy communication to enhance credibility, reviewing the operational approach to Monetary Policy Board members' ""Base Rate Prospects with Conditions for the Next Three Months"" (Bank of Korea, 2025c). The Bank of Korea will also continue efforts to strengthen monetary policy tools in addition to the Base Rate. Discussions are ongoing to reorganize the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility in a manner that reduces its quasi-fiscal policy characteristics, while reinforcing its role as a complementary tool to interest rate policy. Specifically, the facility will place greater emphasis on providing targeted and temporary support to vulnerable sectors, such as regional small and medium-sized enterprises that are relatively more affected by interest rate policy. Also, the Bank will expand the role of lending facilities as a liquidity backstop. Starting this year, the Bank will begin operating the ""Eligible Collateral System for the Utilization of Banks' Loans."" In parallel, from a financial stability perspective, we are also consulting with relevant authorities on amendments to the Bank of Korea Act to allow the coverage of this system to be extended to non-bank deposit-taking institutions (Bank of Korea, 2025d). This will mark an important turning point in further enhancing the central bank's crisis response capacity. Alongside the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank of Korea cannot afford to neglect our role as a think tank on the Korean economy. Over the past three years, in the course of presenting policy alternatives through the ""Structural Reform Research Series,"" our work has at times sparked public debate, and there have also been voices arguing that the Bank should focus on its primary role. However, the main focus of this series has been on how to raise Korea's potential growth rate, which has been on a sustained downward trend, an issue that is closely intertwined with monetary policy as well. According to a recent internal survey, 53% of our staff view the Bank's discussions on structural reform positively, while negative views account for only 9%. It is encouraging to see that an internal consensus has formed on the need for research into structural reforms. Going forward, it will be important not merely to raise issues, but to demonstrate our expertise and competitiveness by presenting practical and realistic solutions to structural challenges. Good examples include the report on won-denominated stablecoins that received an award from the press corps late last year, as well as studies on the introduction of autonomous taxi services, improvements to the life-sustaining treatment decision framework, and sustainable employment for older workers (Bank of Korea, 2025e; Noh, J. et al., 2025; Kim, T. et al., 2025; Oh, S. et al., 2025). Through such high-quality research, the Bank must continue to serve as a compass that helps guide the direction of our economy. Over the past year, the Bank of Korea has devoted considerable efforts not only to addressing the structural challenges facing the Korean economy, but also to advancing internal structural reform initiatives. In particular, advances in digital technology and AI innovation have presented new challenges. To respond proactively to these structural changes in digital finance, the Bank completed the first phase of pilot testing under ""Project Hangang"" last year and plans to carry out the second phase this year (Bank of Korea, 2025f). Through these efforts, the Bank will actively support the government's project to improve national funds management using blockchain technology (Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2025), accumulate practical experience in the use of programmable money, and further strengthen the foundation for the commercialization of digital currency systems and deposit tokens. The Bank believes that the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins is necessary to prepare for a digital currency system, and has already presented possible introduction frameworks that promote innovation while minimizing potential risks. Looking ahead, the Bank will actively participate in legislative discussions with the National Assembly and the government. Regarding AI technological innovation, we plan to unveil the ""Bank of Korea AI Language Model"" by the end of this month, following its development over the past year in collaboration with a major domestic company. We will also proceed without delay with the network integration project to enable more effective use of this model and complete it by March. I hope that all of you will become agents of change by integrating AI into your work, driving innovation in our working methods and evolving into professionals equipped with the capabilities required in a new era. At the same time, I expect that the introduction of this language model based on domestic sovereign AI will serve as an exemplary case of public-private cooperation and contribute to the development of Korea's AI ecosystem. We will continue close cooperation with the private sector so that our sovereign AI can compete on equal footing with overseas AI technologies and maintain its competitiveness. My dear colleagues, As I bring my remarks on policy conduct to a close, I would like to conclude this New Year's Speech by expressing my deep gratitude for the dedication and hard work of all of you. First, I sincerely thank everyone who took part in the voluntary donation campaign at the end of last year, achieving a high participation rate of 79.9%. The fact that more than 2,400 employees came together with a shared sense of purpose is a meaningful testament to our unity and strong sense of community, and it is a source of great pride. I was deeply moved by the warmth and generosity you showed, and I hope that a culture of sharing will take even firmer root within our organization in the years ahead. Moreover, thanks to the organizational culture improvement efforts pursued over the past three years, our organization's dynamism has clearly been strengthened and our staff's capabilities have notably improved. Cooperation and information sharing across departments have expanded, and a culture of open and free exchange of ideas is taking root at a rapid pace. Our research processes are also shifting from a top-down approach to a bottom-up approach. These changes are being recognized externally as well, which is highly encouraging. Media reports citing the Bank's data and publications increased by about 11% year-on-year, while the number of subscribers to our official YouTube channel has surpassed 110,000. 1 Exchanges between our regional branches and local governments have also become more active, including through initiatives such as the ""BOK Regional Economy Symposium."" In addition, I can feel our communication expanding further as staff at regional branches contribute to local media and appear on broadcasts, allowing their capabilities to shine in many different arenas. In this regard, I would like to express my deep gratitude to all of our staff who have done their utmost in their respective roles. I also wish to extend my sincere appreciation to those who have worked diligently behind the scenes in areas such as public service response, currency processing, facilities and security management, administrative support, and environmental maintenance. As I noted at the outset, a range of challenges and tasks await us in the new year. The road ahead will by no means be easy. However, as the saying goes, ""where there is a will, there is a way,"" and if we unite around a common purpose, we will be fully capable of overcoming them. The work we do is complex and at times we may face misunderstandings and criticism. Nevertheless, if we keep firmly in mind our principles and mission as central bankers, and devote ourselves with a clear focus on the long-term stability of the Korean economy, our efforts will surely be recognized. If we are not afraid of making mistakes, but instead treat trial and error as opportunities for learning and continue to strive, the capabilities and culture of our organization will grow ever more mature. Let us open the new year with vigor, drawing on the dynamic energy symbolized by the Year of the Red Horse. Once again, I sincerely wish good health and happiness to all of you and your families. Thank you. I would like to thank Choongwon Park, In Hyup Choi, and Byeongrok Lee for their help in preparing this speech. * This is an unofficial English translation of the original speech released on 2 January 2026. 1 The number of articles mentioning the Bank of Korea, based on data from the Korea Press Foundation's BIG KINDS database, increased from approximately 36,000 in 2024 to about 41,000 in 2025.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good morning and Namaskar. It is my privilege to address the third annual global conference of the College of Supervisors. Advancement in technology is impacting all spheres of human activity – personal, business and public. Financial system is no exception. Technology has revolutionised banking over the years. Yet, today's landscape is distinct - the pace and scale of change are unprecedented. Technology has introduced new products, partners, and processes. Digitalisation is widening access, enhancing efficiency, improving convenience, and enabling far more tailored financial services. At the same time, it is reshaping the nature and scale of risks. It is also accelerating the transmission of disruptions and risks underscoring the need for agility in regulatory and supervisory response. This makes the theme of the conference very apt. I want to focus on five key messages today in my address: i) Systemic resilience as a collaborative effort ii) Supervisory action and enforcement as corrective measures iii) Effective use of data iv) Customer-centricity v) Capacity building I. Systemic resilience as a collaborative effort First, I want to emphasise that we in RBI view our regulatory and supervisory roles vis-a-vis the regulated entities as collaborative and not adversarial. We measure our success as a regulator not only in terms of stability but also the dynamism and vibrancy in the financial sector. Similarly, for the regulated entities to succeed in the long term, stability is essential. Essentially, the objectives and purposes of the regulator and the regulated are the same viz. to ensure the long term growth, advancement, stability, integrity, and credibility of the financial system. The regulators and the regulated are in the same team and not opposite camps. We are partners in the nation's development. Therefore, we have to work together to strike the right balance between growth and systemic stability on the one hand and between responsible innovation and consumer protection on the other hand. I may mention that even the function of regulation and supervision is a collaborative effort. Almost every regulation is finalised through a consultative approach. Moreover, regulated entities also self-regulate through their own internal rules, controls, checks and procedures. Regulated entities have their own, if one can say so, in a broad sense, supervision - through their boards, senior management and assurance teams – both internal and external. Thus, while the statutory mandate to regulate and supervise lies with RBI, the obligation to uphold systemic resilience, to better serve the customers and facilitate the growth of the economy are shared responsibilities. It is a collaborative work with a collective aspiration. Let us all remember that regulation works best when banks and other regulated entities view supervisors not as fault-finding inspectors, but as partners in resilience. For a country like India, where banks play a critical role in financial intermediation and inclusive growth, this collaborative approach is not just desirable-it is essential. II. Supervisory action and enforcement as corrective measures I now come to my second point. Supervisory action and enforcement are often viewed as the most visible aspect of regulation and supervision. It is therefore important to clarify that such actions by the Reserve Bank must be seen as part of a continuum of supervisory tools, not as a standalone response. This continuum begins with training and capacity building and moves through dialogue and guidance, off-site and on-site supervision. Enforcement, restrictions and penalties are measures of last resort. Our endeavour is to have a robust financial ecosystem where supervision encourages self-correction and enforcement acts only as backstop. Moreover, the purpose of enforcement actions undertaken by the Reserve Bank is generally not punitive. The intent is largely to correct. They serve two purposes - (i) signal to those against whom such measures have been initiated; and (ii) make others aware of our acceptable standards of conduct and expectations. III. Effective use of data My third point is related to reports that the regulated entities submit and the data that we collect for various purposes including supervision and regulation. We have undertaken several initiatives in the past to streamline the reporting mechanisms and improve the quality of data. We collect large amounts of data through platforms like CIMS and DAKSH. While some amount of burden is placed on all of you in this process, our supervisory capabilities have been strengthened because of your support. I am happy to note that the quality of data has improved recently, following introduction of the Supervisory Data Quality Index (SDQI) last year. I am confident that we will continue to collaborate for improving the system while reducing the burden placed on regulated entities. While we have made good use of this data, there is scope for more effective use of this data. For example, Department of Supervision can build stronger analytics and supervisory dash boards for enhanced off-site surveillance, to support more continuous monitoring and early risk detection. Our endeavour should be to make supervision more off-site than on-site and as near real-time and not periodic. Increasingly, this will also mean using SupTech and AI-enabled tools more deeply, while retaining judgment and accountability, firmly with supervisors. Similarly, Department of Regulation can use this for evidence based regulation making. It should be our endeavour to make better and effective use of data. IV. Customer-centricity I will now turn my attention to the use of technology for the benefit of customers. For all of us, protecting customers' interest is not just a priority – it has to become the cornerstone of a sustainable and resilient financial system. Digital channels facilitate our efforts by improving inclusion and convenience. But, without guardrails, they can also facilitate opaque pricing, weak disclosures and inappropriate recovery practices. Our aim should be to ensure that digitalisation and innovations are aligned with fair outcomes for consumers. A key element of this endeavour should be to protect customers from the menace of rising digital frauds, which has engaged national attention. While banks and other regulated entities individually should continue to improve their tools, techniques and processes in preventing and tackling digital frauds, this is an area where we need to collaborate with each other to build analytics and tools to detect mule accounts and suspicious transactions timely and pre-emptively. V. Capacity building Before I conclude, let me acknowledge that there are huge expectations from all of us in financial system. To deliver on these expectations, and on our broader mandate, we must improve our effectiveness. This can only be achieved when we have the right mix of skills not only within the Reserve Bank across regulatory and supervisory domains but also within the financial institutions. Moreover, a strong financial system needs supervisors, regulators as also the regulated entities to provide feedback and learn continuously from each other. Regulated entities need to better understand regulatory expectations and requirements, particularly in the areas where models, partners, data, and digital delivery create new forms of risk. They need to imbibe the essence of regulation and follow the spirit of it and not merely follow a tick-box based compliance culture. Our endeavour, rather, should be to develop common understanding which can reduce frictions and improve outcomes. Supervisors and regulators need to provide timely inputs and clarifications. Supervision should not only enforce existing regulations, but also help refine them by flagging regulatory gaps and inconsistencies observed during supervisory engagements. The amendments to the co-lending directions and lending against gold & silver jewellery last year were few recent examples where feedback from all the stakeholders helped us refine regulations. This feedback process is not just limited to supervisory engagement but also includes regulatory or supervisory reporting of data. We need to intensify our engagement and capacity building efforts. This is where institutions like the College of Supervisors (CoS) can contribute immensely. CoS is not only a training institution. It is a platform for building a shared language of oversight, learning from case studies and practical scenarios. It provides a forum for skill upgradation and bridging the information gap between the Reserve Bank and our regulated entities. I urge all of you to collaborate and utilise the facilities offered by the CoS, more often. Conclusion As I conclude my address, I want to emphasise that the fundamental architecture of regulation and supervision remains the same even in the digital era. They still follow the guiding principle of risk sensitivity. Regulated entities still have their stakeholders' interest topmost in mind. Nonetheless, digitalisation has altered the landscape in many ways. I will leave you with a few key points to ponder and deliberate upon: First, regulation and supervision must remain risk-based, proportionate, and technology-neutral; Second, technology must embed compliance, not bypass it; and Third, accountability must remain human, and automation should not dilute accountability -it should sharpen it. I am confident that your deliberations during the day will yield actionable insights on how regulation and supervision should adapt, and how we can forge stronger pathways for cooperation with our key stakeholders and peers. I thank the CoS team for organising this conference and giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts. I wish you a very productive and successful conference. Thank you. Namaskar.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. There are moments that are difficult to explain with figures, analyses, or institutional formulas. Moments in which what is heard is not a position, but an experience. Increasingly often, young, highly educated Bulgarians speak about Bulgaria's European path with an emotion that cannot be learned or simulated – with a confidence that comes not from declarations, but from belonging. A few weeks ago, I attended such a conversation. A Bulgarian who grew up in the Netherlands and today holds a responsible position in a European institution said, quite simply: ""From a young age, I tried to convince my classmates and friends that Bulgaria is part of Europe. They did not understand me. Today, everyone understands."" There was no pose in those words. There was calmness and clarity. Today, the words ""Welcome, Bulgaria"" can be heard and seen in Frankfurt, Brussels, Luxembourg, and in many other places across Europe. Our response to our friends there is brief and clear: ""Thank you, friends. We are home."" This is not protocol. This is a feeling. In this sense, the euro is not merely an economic decision. It is not just a currency. It is a sign of belonging – that your place is not on the periphery, but within a space of shared rules, trust, and responsibility. A sign that the effort you have made has been recognised and accepted. The Bulgarian lev has always been more than money. Its name comes from the lion – a symbol that has accompanied Bulgarian statehood for centuries. The lev remains part of our history and of the memory of generations of Bulgarians. No one is taking it away. It simply takes its place in the story of our country – alongside the marks, francs, and liras of other European nations. The euro does not interrupt this story. It continues it. The Bulgarian letters, the images of the Madara Horseman, Saint Ivan of Rila, and Paisius of Hilendar on European currency state clearly: we are not abandoning who we are. We are affirming who we are. In recent days, this choice was also acknowledged by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew – with that calm authority that does not judge, but recognises the meaning of symbols. A moment that reflects Bulgaria's confident presence in Europe, spiritual maturity, and respect for its own history. Not as a renunciation of identity, but as its confident presence within a broader community. This moment does not call for exaltation. It calls for clarity. And for the calm confidence that belonging, memory, and the future can move forward together. GOD SAVE BULGARIA This is what is written on the newest European coins. And that says enough. Because Bulgaria is Europe. And Europe is Bulgaria. Related information More speeches from ""Bulgarian National Bank"" Country page: Bulgaria",html,2026-02-04 03:14:59,FALSE

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. I would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today. 1 Throughout my now seven years as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I have found that direct outreach with bankers has been the most effective way to learn about and understand your perspectives on improving the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and on local banking and economic conditions. It has now been seven months since I was appointed by President Trump as Vice Chair for Supervision. It is an incredible honor and a profound responsibility to serve in this role. Since I first joined the Board in November 2018, we have faced significant challenges in the banking system and in the economy. Serving on the Board during this time has provided a unique perspective about the banking system and specifically this role, including how to effectively carry out its important responsibilities and promote the safety and soundness of the banking system. Over the past seven months, I have implemented a comprehensive approach to pragmatic supervision and regulation. As we work to preserve safety and soundness, we must ensure the U.S. banking system remains efficient, innovative, and accessible. This is especially important for the small and community banks that serve Americans across the country, including my hometown in Kansas. Drawing from my own experience as a community banker and as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner, I have prioritized tailoring our approach to reflect the unique profiles of banks, refocusing our supervision on early detection and remediation of material financial risks and enhancing transparency in our processes. You know these risks well-they are the core risks that truly threaten the viability and safety and soundness of institutions and the stability of the broader financial system. The past seven years as a Governor have also profoundly shaped my approach to this role. They provided an invaluable, front-row perspective on the evolution of supervisory policy, the internal deliberations of the Board, and the real-world impact of our decisions on banks of all sizes. I observed first-hand how certain regulatory and supervisory practices-which may be well-intended-can drift to focus on subjective, politicized, or tangential issues that divert our attention from the risks that materially impact safety and soundness and financial stability. Leveraging these experiences allows me to explain not just what we are changing, but why -rooting reforms in observed outcomes rather than abstract theory. This approach bridges Washington policymaking with Main Street banking, ensuring that our supervisory and regulatory framework reflects lessons learned and prioritizes what truly matters for safety and soundness and financial stability. Progress in Supervisory and Regulatory Modernization Since June of last year, we have significantly advanced on the agenda I laid out in my Georgetown University speech. 2 While we have made a great deal of progress in just a few months' time, today, I would like to focus on a few of these priorities. Beginning with properly targeted supervision. Supervision is a powerful instrument for promoting safety and soundness. It enables examiners to rigorously assess institutions and detect any material weaknesses requiring remediation. Every institution is distinct-with respect to its products and services, geographic presence, market position, and the specific risks it poses. Supervision is one of our most valuable diagnostic tools. It requires a balanced approach, tough decisions, and reasoned judgement. What is the scope of the examination? Which risks should be prioritized? Are there new or emerging risks that require additional review? To be effective in promoting safety and soundness and U.S. financial stability, supervision must focus on the most important risks-which are the core and material financial risks. In late October 2025, for the first time, the Federal Reserve published supervisory operating principles designed to enhance supervisory transparency and accountability and sharpen our examination processes. 3 These principles direct supervisory staff to identify and require early remediation of material financial risks. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) exposed critical flaws in our prior supervisory approach, which became an ever-expanding scope of unfocused activities that led examiners and the bank to overlook or downplay severe interest-rate and liquidity risks that triggered the bank's collapse and eroded broader public confidence. As I have said a number of times in the past, significant lessons remain from the SVB episode, and we are committed to identifying and rigorously addressing them. Turning back to the operating principles, since their introduction, we have made significant progress in their implementation, including through question and answer sessions with leaders and staff throughout the Federal Reserve System, both at the Board and the Reserve Banks; providing illustrative examples to demonstrate how they should be applied in different circumstances, which we will add to over time; hosting conversations and answering questions from Supervision leaders and staff; and soliciting feedback from regulated firms. If we discover areas that should have been included but were not covered in the initial set of principles, or if we find that there is confusion or misunderstanding about how they should be applied we will refine our approach. We have also made an important change to the LFI ratings framework that applies to the largest banks. The changes ensure that the ""well-managed"" status of a firm is reflective of its overall ratings and risk, rather than disproportionately weighting a single supervisory component to drive this overall assessment of the firm. While this is an important step, we recognize that there is more work to be done on bank ratings frameworks, which I will discuss shortly. We have also eliminated the use of ""reputational risk"" in the supervisory process. In the past, this imprecise supervisory tool has been misused to prohibit politically disfavored activities. And in furtherance of our focus on core and material financial risks, we have rescinded the climate guidance that diverted supervisory resources away from risks that are material to the safety and soundness of banks. This guidance forced institutions to devote excessive resources to collecting climate-related data from customers and prospective customers, and to forecast business risks beyond any reasonable or reliable forecasting window, potentially decades into the future-all to address risks that banks are already required to manage. In short, these climate principles did little to further our statutory objectives to protect safety and soundness and financial stability. Banking inherently involves risk. The regulatory framework aims not to eliminate risk, but to ensure the safe and sound management of risk. With proper prioritization, regulators and examiners can foster robust risk management while enabling banks to innovate, grow, and serve their customers, communities, and the broader U.S. economy. Since the mortgage crisis more than 15 years ago, bank regulation has been implemented under an overly granular ""more-is-better"" approach that has driven significant banking activity out of the regulated system and into less-supervised corners of the financial landscape. This framework is long overdue for a comprehensive review. An unfocused, process-heavy approach to regulation and supervision leaves banks less able to support economic activity, displaces activity into unregulated sectors, and ultimately makes the overall financial system less safe and stable. In recent months, we have introduced meaningful improvements, including publishing several proposals for public comment, and finalizing several critical reforms. We have proposed re-calibrating the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) to the statutory minimum to provide greater flexibility to eligible community banks. This would change the required level of capital for community banks electing the CBLR from 9 percent to 8 percent, a level that is still nearly double the required Tier 1 leverage ratio and preserves a strong capital foundation for these firms. The CBLR allows a community bank to choose to meet a single leverage capital requirement instead of the risk-based measures designed for larger banks. In addition to meeting the statutory capital requirement, it enables more community banks to take advantage of the relief that Congress intended. We look forward to receiving comments and ultimately finalizing the proposed revisions. We have also modified the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), returning it to its traditional role as a leverage-based backstop to risk-based capital requirements. In doing so, we are making real progress to enhance the stability of the U.S. Treasury market by enhancing intermediation capacity for large bank-affiliated broker-dealers. In addition, we are in the process of revising and enhancing the stress testing program to reduce year-over-year volatility, improve the reliability and accuracy of the models, and increase transparency. And in the coming days and weeks, the Board will announce additional regulatory changes to improve the fairness, transparency, and prioritization of the supervisory process. The Path Forward: Bank Regulatory and Supervisory Reforms While I hope that you are already seeing the benefits of these initial modernization efforts, there are a number of additional initiatives underway that will materially improve the bank regulatory framework for all sizes of banks-especially for community banks. Improving Supervision – Memorializing Changes in Regulation Staff will soon conclude several regulatory proposals that will guide our supervisory work. The first proposal would define what constitutes ""unsafe and unsound"" practices for supervision and enforcement activities. The second removes ""reputation risk"" from the supervisory process. These proposals will largely align with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposals, and are intended to demonstrate the Federal Reserve's commitment to transparency, fairness, and efficiency, which are the core principles I have supported for many years. Updating and Indexing Asset Thresholds Bank supervision and regulation applies based on the categorization of banks into ""portfolios,"" which are based on a combination of fixed statutory and regulatory thresholds. Many of these portfolios rely on only a single, fixed asset level, like the definition of a community bank at $10 billion or a large bank at $100 billion. This type of definition relies only on the bank's asset size regardless of its activities, business model, or risk profile. Among many other shortcomings, this approach does not account for economic growth and inflation over time. As a result, firms with stable growth, consistent business models, and no change in risk profile end up crossing asset thresholds and becoming subject to increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. While asset thresholds for portfolios play a significant role in the supervisory process, there are a wide range of thresholds that impact banks across the regulatory and statutory frameworks. Looking ahead, we will reconsider these regulatory thresholds and will work to support Congress in updating thresholds that have become outdated and too low relative to the broader economy. A simple solution would be to adjust thresholds by nominal GDP, which includes both economic growth and inflation. Doing so will result in a more robust and resilient system over time, proactively integrating indexed changes into the framework. It may also be worth considering whether single-metric thresholds, like those based purely on asset size, are the most effective way to align statutory, regulatory, and supervisory requirements with the underlying risk of the activity, or whether a more nuanced approach may be appropriate. For example, a more nuanced approach could consider things like business model and risk profile as inputs. I look forward to working with Congress and my regulatory colleagues to address these and other opportunities to update the regulatory framework. I also support taking a comprehensive approach to indexing statutory requirements broadly across all financial agency authorities, including for requirements that I did not directly reference in my remarks today. Supervisory Portfolios In several speeches over the past few years, I have outlined considerations for a more effective approach to supervising community banks. 4 This would require better aligning our supervisory approach to the complexity and risk profile of smaller institutions. Community banks should be subject to strict supervisory oversight, but it must be commensurate with their smaller size, simpler business activities, and the modest risks they pose to U.S. financial stability. This could be accomplished by separating the community bank oversight program from those designed for larger and regional banks, focusing examiner attention on small bank risks and activities. This would also eliminate the temptation to ""push down"" standards and expectations to community banks, that were designed for larger and more complex institutions. Material Financial Risk To avoid confusion, it may also be helpful to clarify what is meant by identifying material financial risks in the supervisory process. It does not mean focusing primarily on checking boxes in reviewing processes, procedures, and documentation, regardless of the assessment of risk. It also does not mean ignoring other aspects of the established supervisory program. As the supervisory operating principles note, focusing on material financial risks requires examiners to use reasoned judgment to prioritize through every stage of an examination. This begins with targeting in the pre-examination letter, the examination's scope of work, and differentiating between findings that meet the threshold of a matter requiring attention, and those that can be addressed through less formal means. The operating principles specifically reference supervisory observations for those matters that do not rise to the level of a violation but may be included in an examination report. Reducing Overlap in Examinations In conducting holding company supervision, the Federal Reserve is required by statute to rely ""to the fullest extent possible"" on examinations performed by a subsidiary bank's primary state or federal supervisors. In practice, complying with this requirement imposes significant limits on the Fed's supervisory activities. This applies to national banks regulated by the OCC and state non-member banks regulated by the FDIC and a state banking regulator. 5 The requirement is designed to avoid redundant and burdensome examination processes. However, to be effective, the Fed must have confidence in the supervisory processes and outcomes of these OCC, FDIC, and state banking agency exams, which requires access to and a thorough review of examination reports and activities. Where it is not possible to rely on or we do not have access to an exam or supporting documentation of supervisory activity, we may need to conduct our own review. Reports of Examination and Supervisory Ratings Each bank examination concludes with a report of examination. This report documents exam findings including any supervisory observations or criticisms, and matters requiring attention (MRAs) or matters requiring immediate attention (MRIAs), if any are found during the exam. The report also includes the bank's supervisory ratings according to the CAMELS rating system. 6 Exam findings and the inclusion of specific matters in the report can have serious consequences for the bank. In addition to directing how banks prioritize their efforts to remediate identified issues, the bank's CAMELS rating can influence whether the bank qualifies to receive favorable treatment of banking applications, affect the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, affect the cost of liquidity funding, and serve as an indication of bank management performance for its board of directors. The supervisory operating principles emphasize that examination findings and reports must focus on material financial risk. We are currently implementing several initiatives to reflect this approach including: revisiting the standard for issuing MRAs and MRIAs; ensuring that CAMELS ratings reflect a bank's risk profile and financial condition, including that the ""M"" for management is assessed on measurable factors; and reviving the use of non-binding supervisory ""observations,"" which identify matters of note that do not rise to the level of an MRA or MRIA. Although supervisory observations are not ""binding"" on the firm, in the sense that they do not require formal remediation, these informal communications are valuable for early identification of issues that may grow to become potential concerns. They also encourage constructive communication and feedback between examiners and bank management. Reporting and Applications Our work to modernize the frameworks also includes reporting and applications, especially for community banks. The obligation to provide data or other information, including through quarterly bank ""call reports"" creates a disproportionate burden on community banks. Often, regulators and supervisors do not review the information and data that is submitted. This presents an opportunity to revisit these data collections in a rigorous review that would ensure that each collection remains relevant and necessary for supervisory purposes, including whether there are lower-cost and less burdensome alternatives available. This certainly is a departure from recent regulatory approaches, in which more is always better, but collecting less information can help us to ensure we are focused on collecting the right and most valuable information. Revisiting our long-standing processes will help us to understand whether we have struck the right balance. Refining our approach to data collection can make a meaningful difference in reducing burden while also maintaining robust oversight and high standards. Like all banks, community banks often require regulatory approval to engage in some business activities and mergers, or to engage in new activities. The process of applying for regulatory approval has become uncertain, cumbersome, disruptive, and slow. In some cases, application forms may not require a bank to submit the necessary information needed to evaluate an application. The application process may also include standards that make little sense when applied to community banks, like using restrictive screens for evaluating the competitive effects of mergers in rural and underserved communities. In addition, the process often lacks specific action timelines necessary for business planning purposes. Mergers and acquisitions involve coordinating a number of time-dependent processes, including transaction closing and staffing related planning, and the process of scheduling technology integrations with specialized vendors. Missing deadlines can be costly for the institutions involved, and we are currently working to improve this process by addressing these and other challenges, especially for community banks. Transparency Finally, I would like to discuss transparency, which I see as a critical element of the regulatory and supervisory processes. Transparency in supervisory expectations is just as important as transparency in regulatory requirements, and yet it often receives the least scrutiny and attention. In part, the lack of transparency for supervision results from information security rules and how they apply to communication between banks and examiners. These have been protected from public scrutiny under the broad categorization of ""confidential supervisory information"" (CSI). Labeling information as CSI results in significant restrictions on its disclosure-banks and bank employees are subject to criminal penalties if they disclose CSI without regulatory approval even if doing so would serve beneficial purposes for bank safety and soundness. When banks share the latest information about fraud prevention among themselves-if some of the data is currently classified as CSI-the disclosure can be prohibited, even if sharing it could make all banks more resilient to emerging fraud risks. Likewise, bank regulators dedicate a great deal of time and effort to reviewing bank cyber risk profiles and controls, and yet opportunities for collaboration and sharing can be limited by the fear that sharing CSI could result in criminal penalties. These examples demonstrate how expansive the definition of CSI has become. The vague and over-broad definition and interpretation of CSI effectively prohibit constructive speech and information sharing. In addition to limiting valuable uses of information sharing, the limits can also serve to shield abusive supervisory behaviors. To address these weaknesses, we are reviewing approaches to better define or create circumstances in which CSI can be shared, including through creating limited use cases exempt from the definition of CSI. In another initiative to increase transparency, in December, we finally published a copy of the LISCC Operating Manual, which is one of the manuals used by Board and Reserve Bank staff to supervise the largest and most complex banks. 7 We plan to release the remaining LISCC administrative manuals in the coming weeks and months. The public release of these manuals is just the beginning of our efforts to increase the transparency of our administrative processes. We are working to identify other manuals and guidance to further enhance transparency and provide public accountability for our supervisory processes. Even though these documents are internally focused, they can give banks and the broader public insight into supervisory operations and expectations. Closing Thoughts As we continue our work to modernize the bank regulatory framework and our supervisory approach, I look forward to engaging with our stakeholders for feedback. Informal conversations, round table discussions and attending conferences like this one are helpful to achieve this goal. It also allows us to better understand the real-world consequences of our work. Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss our work with you today. 1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 Michelle W.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear and honored guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of the Banque de France, our warmest wishes to you and your loved ones. This year, France is taking on the G7 Presidency, with a number of priorities – addressing global imbalances but also delivering practical progress on six financial stability items: cross-border payments, NBFI, cybersecurity, AI, quantum technology and climate-related risks. It is therefore my pleasure to introduce today's stimulating sessions dedicated to the challenges of digital innovation and the consequences for the International Monetary System (IMS). Let me first outline two major disruptions, a fast-moving technological one and a slow-moving geopolitical one – to quote Governor Panetta's recent speech – (1), before sharing with you a triangle of three objectives, three ""S's"" that should guide us in the transition to a new global landscape for payments (2). 1. Two major disruptions are affecting the international monetary landscape 1.1. A technological disruption The first disruption is technological: financial innovations have the potential to reshape the IMS. Among them, tokenisation is accelerating end-to-end transaction execution and reducing costs, notably through ""smart contracts"". It can revolutionise cross-border payments and possibly domestic payments. Tokenisation could affect the IMS through two opposite forces. On the one hand, it may reinforce the US dollar's centrality with a potentially rapid development of stablecoins in USD held outside the United States. Supported by a resilient US financial sector and actively promoted by the US administration, stablecoins – 99% USD-backed so far – could reach a market capitalisation of between USD 500 billion and USD 2 trillion by 2028 according to some projections.

Dear journalists, experts, and media executives, Dear ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your participation in this end-of-year meeting, which has by now become a well-established forum for dialogue between the Bank of Albania and media representatives. This meeting serves as both a platform to reflect on the economic and financial developments of the year drawing to a close and to acknowledge the crucial role of the media in informing the public, fostering confidence, and strengthening institutional transparency. Against the backdrop of an increasingly complex environment, in which monetary and financial decision-making is shaped by a wide range of domestic and external factors, clear, accurate and professional communication is of paramount importance. In this context, our collaboration has been instrumental in ensuring that the public receives reliable, clear, and balanced information on economic developments in Albania. The year 2025 has been of particular significance for the Bank of Albania, not only in light of the economic challenges addressed and achievements attained, but also owing to its historical importance. This year marked the centenary of the central bank's founding-a milestone that invites both a proud reflection on the past and a responsible consideration of the challenges ahead. From the economic and financial perspective, the Albanian economy has continued to exhibit a positive performance. Economic activity expanded at a steady pace, the labour market remained robust, and inflation stayed at low levels. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Albania's monetary policy stance has been prudent and stability-oriented, seeking to strike an appropriate balance between maintaining price stability and supporting sustainable economic growth. The Albanian banking system has continued to demonstrate resilience and a high degree of financial soundness. Banks remain well capitalised, liquidity is ample and the quality of credit portfolio has continued to improve. This stability-far from being coincidental-is the result of a robust regulatory framework, effective supervision and ongoing close cooperation between the Bank of Albania and the banking sector. Throughout this journey, the media has played an indispensable role. Through analysis, informed debate, and professional interpretation, you have contributed significantly to explaining our policy decisions, clarifying economic concepts, and shaping public expectations. This role is particularly important at a time when information circulates rapidly, and the risks associated with misinformation are tangible. The celebration of the Bank of Albania's centenary has served as an important platform for reflection and public communication. Through a range of institutional, academic, and cultural events, we have sought to highlight the close link between the central bank's history and that of the Albanian state, as well as its enduring role in promoting monetary stability and fostering public confidence in institutions. This anniversary serves as a reminder that independence, professionalism, and transparency are core values that must be safeguarded and strengthened on an ongoing basis. Within this context, public communication remains one of our key strategic priorities. The Bank of Albania recognises that its decisions have a direct impact on citizens, businesses, and financial markets. Accordingly, we have invested-and will continue to invest-in enhancing the effectiveness of our communication, with a view to making information more accessible, clearer, and more comprehensive for the broader public. The fight against disinformation represents a key challenge of our time. In an environment where opinions are increasingly intertwined with facts, the role of professional and responsible media is pivotal. In this regard, we consider the media as a key partner in pursuing a shared objective: ensuring accurate information and enhancing economic and financial literacy across society. Looking ahead, the priorities of the Bank of Albania remain clear. Monetary and financial stability will continue to stand at the core of our mandate. In parallel, we will intensify our efforts to modernise payment systems, advance digitalisation and further align with European standards, with a view to supporting Albania's continued integration into the European Union. Dear guests, This meeting also provides an opportunity to thank you for your accurate and professional collaboration throughout the year. Your critiques, questions and analyses help us to communicate more clearly, act more responsibly and maintain greater transparency. Open dialogue with the media remains a crucial element in the effective functioning of a central bank. Wishing you ongoing success in your work and a very prosperous end of the year, I am confident that our constructive collaboration will endure in the years ahead, supporting both public information and the economic stability of the country. We will now turn to a specific point on the agenda of this meeting. It is with pleasure that we announce the winners of the ""Governor's Award for the Best Diploma Thesis"", a long-standing tradition of the Bank of Albania that underscores our commitment to promoting both scientific research and academic excellence. This year, 38 students submitted their undergraduate and master's theses, presenting well-structured and insightful research on topics of particular relevance to policymakers, society, and the private sector in Albania. These studies provide significant added value by addressing current and pressing issues, offering well-founded conclusions, and proposing practical solutions. We are pleased to note a considerable increase in the number of theses that approach these topics through empirical analysis. Students not only make judicious use of existing information and databases but also enhance them through surveys and other statistical research, thereby strengthening both the quality and reliability of their findings. As a result, the Committee finds the task of selecting the most outstanding works increasingly challenging, given the high calibre of submissions received. I congratulate you on your outstanding work and encourage you to apply the knowledge and skills you have demonstrated with dedication and insight in the institutions you will serve in the future. With my sincere thanks once again, I am pleased to proceed with the announcement of this year's awards.

A recent Microsoft study reports that 64 percent of the UAE’s working age population uses AI, which is the highest rate globally. This illustrates the dynamism we see in the region—and the major investments and partnerships that some of the world’s biggest tech companies are making here. Why such a huge commitment to this region? Because the UAE and the members of the GCC all understand just how transformative AI can be. They have made systemically significant investments in human capital over the last decades. IMF estimates show that, with the right measures in place, AI could fuel a boost to global productivity of up to 0.8 percentage points per year. This could raise global growth to levels exceeding those of the pre-pandemic period. Here in the Gulf region, AI could boost non-oil GDP in Gulf countries even more, by up to 2.8 percent. For economies that have long been dependent on hydrocarbon exports, this presents an enormous opportunity to diversify and build new sources of growth. Now, major technology changes often bring disruption. And sure enough, we can expect disruption from AI. Especially to labor markets. On average, 40 percent of jobs globally will be impacted by AI - either upgraded, or eliminated or transformed. For advanced economies, 60 percent of jobs will be affected. This is like a tsunami hitting the labor market. We are already seeing the evidence: about one in 10 job postings in advanced economies now require at least one new skill. Workers with in-demand skills will likely see productivity and wage gains. This will create more demand for services, and increase employment and wages among low-skilled workers. But middle-skilled jobs will be squeezed. That means that young people and the middle class will be hit hardest. We can expect to see a similar divergence between countries. Those with an economic structure conducive to AI adoption—that is, strong digital infrastructure, more skilled labor forces, and robust regulatory frameworks—are likely to experience the largest and fastest benefits. Countries that don’t may get left behind. This is why we gathered here today. AI looks unstoppable. But whether or not countries can successfully capitalize on AI’s enormous promise is yet to be determined. And this will largely depend on the policy regimes they put in place. So then, what must be done to ensure AI translates into broad-based prosperity for this region? First, macro policies. Investment and innovation in AI will boost growth. Fiscal policies can support this by strengthening tax systems and by funding research, reskilling, or sector-based training programs. However, tax systems should not encourage automation at the expense of people. Likewise, effective financial regulation will be essential to ensure financial market efficiency and improved risk management. Second, guardrails. AI needs to be regulated to ensure it’s safe, fair, and trustworthy—but without stifling innovation. Different countries are taking different approaches, ranging from risk-based frameworks to high-level principles. Whatever approach they take, it’s critical that countries coordinate. That brings me to my third point: cooperation and partnerships. Scale is a big advantage in AI. But you can’t get scale without cooperation among governments, AI researchers and developers, including when it comes to data sharing and knowledge transfer. Let me conclude. AI will transform our economies. It will present immense opportunities and pose significant risks. And it falls to you, the world’s policymakers, to ensure that the opportunities are maximized for your countries and the risks controlled. Thank you.

The authorities have consented to the publication of the Staff Report prepared for this consultation.[2] Poland has shown significant resilience to recent global shocks. The primary driver for growth has been private consumption due to a strong rebound in real wages. Fiscal stimulus in recent years has also played a role. These expansionary forces have been partially counterbalanced by appropriately tight monetary policy which dampened private investment. In addition, while direct exposure to US tariffs is limited, export growth has been moderate, largely due to soft EU demand. The current account has fallen to 1 percent of GDP deficit, reflecting a rapid increase in imports. Fiscal imbalances have widened considerably. In 2025, the fiscal deficit and public debt are projected to reach 7 percent and 59 percent of GDP, respectively. Poland has the second largest fiscal deficit in Europe this year even though the output gap is largely closed. The widening of the fiscal deficit since 2021 solely reflects a substantial increase in expenditures. Spending now matches levels in advanced European economies—despite differences in composition—while revenues remain closer to levels seen in Central and Eastern Europe. Disinflation is on track helping support monetary policy normalization. Headline and core inflation returned to the target, driven by goods, while services inflation has remained elevated. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored in consumer and producer surveys. With this progress in disinflation, the National Bank of Poland’s (NBP) has gradually reduced policy rates by 175 bps to 4 percent in 2025. The gradual monetary easing has supported credit recovery with banks remaining well capitalized, liquid and profitable, while non-performing loans are declining. Executive Board Assessment[3] Poland’s near-term outlook is favorable, with growth projected to accelerate to 3.3 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2026, driven by a sharp increase in EU fund execution and monetary easing. Inflation has declined into the target range, and the output gap is expected to close in 2026. Nonetheless, risks remain elevated, including fiscal vulnerabilities, declining price competitiveness, global trade developments and regional security concerns. Staff assesses the external position in 2025 to be broadly in line with the levels implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Over time, growth is expected to moderate as EU-financed investment wanes and fiscal consolidation continues. Stabilizing public debt should be a key priority. Under current policies, debt is projected to rise significantly above the EU benchmark of 60 percent of GDP, reaching 78 percent of GDP by 2031. Staff recommends a cumulative fiscal adjustment of 4 percent of GDP to reverse this trend. The composition of consolidation depends on Poland’s social preferences regarding the size and role of the state. The recent widening of the deficit stems entirely from net higher spending—driven by expanded social benefits, a better-compensated public sector, and increased defense outlays. Poland must either raise more revenue to sustain these services or return to a leaner public sector with more efficient and targeted spending. Building on recent gains in fiscal transparency, establishing a well-resourced and independent fiscal council would strengthen fiscal governance. The disinflation process is proceeding well, but monetary policy should now proceed cautiously. Services inflation remains elevated, and economic activity is set to accelerate. Staff advocates a wait-and-see approach to allow time to observe incoming data and to ensure that inflation remains close to the mid-point of the target range on a sustained basis. If economic activity and core inflation begin to fall in a manner that suggests inflation might undershoot the lower end of the target range, further easing would be advisable. Throughout, we see MPC communication that underscores the decision-making process as more constructive than specific predictions for rates. The banking sector is stable and well-capitalized, but there is scope to reduce frictions to credit provision. While credit is recovering, structural barriers—including legal risks and distortionary taxation—continue to constrain financial intermediation. In this regard, staff welcomes the recent reduction in the bank asset tax and encourages going further by eliminating it in a fiscally neutral manner. The objectives of the recently introduced Long-Term Funding Ratio have merit but should be redesigned to avoid unintended consequences that would raise the cost of credit and further undermine credit creation. In addition, legal risks around mortgage contracts should be addressed through proportionate penalties and standardized templates to reduce uncertainty and improve access to credit. Structural reforms at both the national and EU levels are critical to sustaining convergence. Poland’s labor productivity growth remains strong, but innovation lags and demographic pressures are mounting. Staff recommends measures to enhance labor mobility, digital skills, and participation, including gradual increases in the retirement age and better integration of migrant workers. Capital market reforms should improve household returns and expand firm financing. The OKI and Innovate Poland initiatives are promising but should avoid excessive home bias and promote broad participation. Deeper EU integration—especially in energy and capital markets—will support productivity and resilience. While Poland has made progress on decarbonization, further efforts are needed to meet climate targets and preserve competitiveness. Table 1.

The Czech economy continues to expand at a robust pace but faces mounting structural headwinds.","February 3, 2026 A Concluding Statement describes the preliminary findings of IMF staff at the end of an official staff visit (or ‘mission’), in most cases to a member country. Missions are undertaken as part of regular (usually annual) consultations under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, in the context of a request to use IMF resources (borrow from the IMF), as part of discussions of staff monitored programs, or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments. Prague, Czech Republic. The Czech economy continues to expand at a robust pace but faces mounting structural headwinds. Increasing global competition, high concentration of trading partners and export products, and elevated energy intensity leave the economy exposed to external shocks, while adverse demographic trends weigh on potential growth. Although public debt is moderate, preserving fiscal space in this uncertain environment is essential. A significant fiscal stimulus at a time when the economy is already operating at or near potential would likely fuel inflation and lead to higher interest rates. Conversely, advancing structural reforms at the national level and deepening integration within the EU Single Market would raise potential growth and ease the burden of future fiscal consolidation. Monetary policy should remain on hold in the near term, unless incoming data, including wage developments or changes in fiscal policy, materially alter the inflation outlook. While financial stability risks are currently contained, they warrant close vigilance and call for recalibration of some instruments in the macroprudential toolkit as risks evolve. Recent Developments The Czech economy expanded in 2025, driven primarily by domestic demand. Growth was robust, averaging an estimated 2.5 percent, as real wages continued to recover from their post-pandemic decline, supporting household consumption. Public investment also strengthened, on the back of sustained absorption of EU funds. In contrast, private investment and export growth moderated amid heightened global policy uncertainty and rising trade barriers, following a period of front-loaded external demand earlier in the year. Headline inflation has eased, but core inflation remains sticky. At year-end, headline inflation stood at 2.1 percent, broadly in line with the CNB’s inflation target, while core inflation edged up to 2.8 percent, driven by persistently elevated services price growth, including housing-related costs. Sustained nominal wage growth, around 7 percent, continues to exert upward pressure on services prices, where labor is a key input. Outlook and Risks Growth is projected to level off and gradually moderate in the medium term. GDP is expected to expand at a similar pace in 2026, closing the output gap. Consumption should remain strong in the near term, as real wages continue to recover and the saving rate declines slightly. Fixed investment is set to pick up, supported by lower interest rates, while exports are expected to recover more gradually following recent trade disruptions. As export performance strengthens but the catch-up in household income fades, medium-term growth is projected to slow toward its estimated potential of 1.8 percent, constrained by demographic pressures and modest productivity gains. Inflation is expected to undershoot the CNB’s 2 percent target in the near term. Staff project headline inflation to fall below 2 percent this year, supported by the removal of the renewable energy surcharge and lower energy prices. Core inflation, however, is expected to decline more gradually, reflecting persistent wage growth and housing-related cost pressures. Staff’s forecast is subject to considerable uncertainty, with near-term risks to both growth and inflation skewed to the upside and medium-term risks tilted to the downside. A shift toward more expansionary fiscal policy could temporarily raise growth further above potential, fueling services and property price inflation and potentially triggering higher wage claims. The size of these effects would depend on the composition of spending and its import content. The required monetary tightening in response to such a shock would help anchor inflation expectations but would also weigh on growth over time, while wider sovereign spreads could raise borrowing costs. Conversely, persistent global policy uncertainty, trade disputes, or a correction in global asset valuations could dampen growth and increase inflation volatility. Fiscal Policy—Balancing Social Priorities with Fiscal Sustainability The 2026 budget implies a moderately expansionary fiscal stance. The revised budget envisages higher spending on social benefits and transport infrastructure, partly financed through lower than previously planned defense outlays and the postponement of financial commitments related to the Dukovany nuclear power plant expansion. While budgetary accruals remain uncertain, especially regarding the timing of military equipment procurement, staff project the general government deficit to widen to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2026, compared with an estimated 2 percent in 2025, consistent with a moderate fiscal expansion. Significant spending pressures are set to build steadily over the coming years, underscoring the need for fiscal consolidation. Aging-related expenditures and sizable investment needs to strengthen energy security are projected to weigh increasingly on the fiscal position, and a rollback of the recent pension reform would add further strain. Absent consolidation, the public debt ratio would approach 60 percent by 2034, with gross financing needs rising persistently and eroding fiscal space. Staff therefore recommend an annual fiscal adjustment of 0.5 percentage points during 2027-30 to converge toward a sustained structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP, which would stabilize the debt ratio below 50 percent by 2030. Maintaining the deficit at this level through 2040 amid mounting expenditure pressures would require additional measures of roughly 1.5 percent of GDP, bringing total consolidation needs to around 3.5 percent of GDP. Delays in initiating consolidation would further increase the required adjustment. Social priorities should be pursued in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability. Staff urge the authorities to assess carefully the implications of capping the retirement age and modifying pension indexation parameters. Containing growth in the public sector wage bill, including at the local government level, remains essential to safeguard fiscal space. Efforts to address affordability and demographic challenges are welcome. However, strengthening means-testing to improve targeting of social benefits would help ensure that support reaches low-income households while containing fiscal costs. Staff also encourage the authorities to explore efficiency gains through comprehensive spending reviews and by reallocating expenditures toward more productive uses. Ongoing efforts to strengthen tax compliance should be complemented by a broader reassessment of the tax structure. Staff welcome the initiative to reintroduce electronic registration of sales to bolster compliance and reduce tax evasion, especially in sectors with high cash transactions. These measures would be even more effective if accompanied by further digitalization of tax processes. Staff also see merit in rebalancing the tax structure: social security contributions account for nearly half of total revenue, while property tax collection remains among the lowest in the EU, at 0.3 percent of GDP (compared to an OECD average of around 1.7 percent). Transitioning to a value-based property tax system would help curb speculative demand, activate idle housing, and enhance housing market efficiency. Part of the additional revenue from such a reform could be used by municipalities to improve the quality of services and be directed toward social housing investment, helping ease affordability pressures. Monetary Policy—Managing Risks through Scenario Analysis Staff assess the current monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate. While headline inflation is projected to fall below target, persistently elevated core inflation and a closing output gap leave limited room for further easing. The current 3.5 percent policy rate lies within the range of neutral rate estimates, and the lagged impact of a stronger koruna provides restraint. Monetary policy should therefore remain on hold, unless incoming data, including wage developments or changes in fiscal policy, materially alter the inflation outlook. Elevated domestic and global uncertainty underscores the importance of integrating scenario analysis more systematically into policy deliberations. Staff welcome the CNB’s review of its monetary policy analytical and modeling framework, aimed at diversifying methodologies and strengthening scenario-based approaches. In this context, the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework offers a useful lens for assessing appropriate policy responses to shocks. An application of the framework to the Czech Republic suggests that, in the event of a correction in global asset valuations leading to currency depreciation, reserves could be used in combination with tighter monetary policy to mitigate inflationary pressures and output losses rather than relying only on the policy rate. Conversely, a domestic fiscal expansion that contributes to the buildup of macroeconomic imbalances should be countered exclusively with tighter monetary policy and strengthened communication to keep inflation expectations anchored. Staff reiterate the importance of central bank balance sheet normalization over time. The CNB maintains an outsized balance sheet with reserves exceeding 300 percent of the IMF’s ARA metric, largely a legacy of the 2013-17 exchange rate floor. The central bank has been managing large excess koruna liquidity through standard repo operations, limiting reserve sales in a shallow FX market to minimize the impact on the exchange rate. While this approach has preserved policy transmission, it has entailed significant costs, especially during periods of elevated interest rates, when the remuneration of repo operations exceeds returns on FX reserves. Large reserve holdings also expose the CNB balance sheet to exchange rate movements. The CNB has diversified its FX reserves to include higher-yield assets, raising returns but also market and credit risk. Staff therefore reiterate the case for considering a gradual balance sheet normalization through a transparent mechanism of preannounced, small, and regular FX sales. This would still leave sizable reserves against future shocks. Risks of a more expansionary fiscal policy reinforce the case for balance sheet normalization. Financial Policies—Calibrating Macroprudential Tools with Evolving Risks Financial stability risks remain contained but have risen amid real estate developments and elevated interconnectedness. The recovery in household real incomes is supporting repayment capacity, and new mortgages are predominantly extended to high-income households, whose accumulated savings provide a buffer even at elevated debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratios. Banks’ lending standards remain prudent. Nonetheless, rapid property price growth, driven in part by factors outside the mortgage market, and the expanding presence of institutional investors, have broader financial stability implications and warrant close vigilance. The bank-sovereign nexus also merits attention. Czech government securities are issued exclusively on the domestic market, which helps absorb structural excess liquidity but increases interconnectedness risks. Rising financial stability risks point to a need to recalibrate some instruments in the macroprudential toolkit. Staff welcome the CNB’s recent recommendations to tighten loan-to-value and debt-to-income (DTI) limits for investment mortgages, given their higher risk profile, and urge continued close monitoring of the buy-to-let segment. While current risks remain contained, these measures can help prevent a further buildup of vulnerabilities. Should the share of investment mortgages in new lending continue to grow, the CNB could consider additional measures. These may include recommending regionally differentiated limits or reactivating DSTI and DTI limits more broadly. The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is a less effective instrument to address mortgage-specific risks; however, a further broad-based upswing in the financial cycle extending to corporate credit, would warrant increasing the CCyB rate above the current 1.25 percent. Accessing the Eurobond market may help diversify the investor base of Czech sovereign securities, while meeting increasing FX funding needs related to defense and energy investments. Structural Policies—Supporting Growth and Complementing Fiscal Consolidation Facing mounting structural headwinds, the Czech Republic is gradually transitioning from a manufacturing-driven, export-oriented hub to a more mature and diversified economy, with ICT and financial services gaining importance. While a significant fiscal stimulus when the economy is at or near potential could fuel inflation, advancing structural reforms at the national level, alongside deeper integration within the EU Single Market, would boost potential growth and ease the burden of fiscal consolidation. Sustaining this progress while ensuring resilience in traditional sectors will require a better allocation of skilled labor to address shortages, deeper capital markets, reliable energy supply, and affordable housing. The mission would like to thank the Czech authorities for their warm hospitality, open collaboration, and fruitful discussions.
