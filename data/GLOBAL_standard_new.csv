He outlines the Bank’s role in maintaining low and stable inflation while helping the economy through the transition.","Structural change—Canada at a crossroads Introduction Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back at the Empire Club to deliver my first speech of the year. And what a year it’s shaping up to be. Last week, the Bank of Canada held its policy rate at 2¼%—and we had two key messages. First, our economic outlook has not changed much since last fall, but uncertainty around our forecast has increased. We continue to expect the Canadian economy to grow modestly and inflation to stay close to the 2% target. But geopolitical risks are heightened, and US trade policy remains unpredictable. Second, the Canadian economy is adjusting to US protectionism. Canadian businesses are looking for new suppliers and new markets. This restructuring, which includes shifting our trade and integrating our internal market, will take some time. But in time, it will strengthen our economy. Today, I want to focus on this second theme—structural change and what it means for the Canadian economy. Canada is at a crossroads. The era of rules-based open trade with the United States is over, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) looms large, and our demographics are shifting. The impact of these forces on the Canadian economy will not be a temporary cyclical fluctuation. These are deep structural changes that are transforming the economic landscape. And how Canada responds—which road we take—will define our economic future. The Bank of Canada needs to understand the economic implications of structural change to deliver on our mandate—low and stable inflation. Governments need to understand it to direct public investment, encourage private investment and use industrial policy to capitalize on our economic strengths. Businesses need to understand it to develop new markets and products, invest in productivity-enhancing technology and help their workers gain skills for the future. And Canadians need to understand it so they can see the opportunity, while managing what could be difficult adjustments along the way. That’s a lot to navigate in a short speech, so let me break it down into three manageable questions. First, what do we expect for the economy this year and next—what does structural change mean for growth, jobs and inflation? Second, where do we see adjustments already happening, and what could be in store in the years ahead? And finally, what are the monetary policy implications? This last question is important because monetary policy should not try to mitigate structural change. Our role is to preserve price stability while supporting the economy through the upheaval. That’s easy to say, but hard to do in the moment. What is structural change? Before I tackle these three big questions, I want to start by defining what we mean by structural change. Things are always changing in the economy. Oil prices, the stock market and exchange rates go up and down. Consumer and business sentiment shifts. And the strength of the global economy ebbs and flows. But these changes are not structural change. Structural change is bigger and broader—and it’s not temporary. It permanently changes the level or composition of economic activity. It alters what and how much the Canadian economy can produce at full capacity without causing inflation. Structural change is a journey. It’s the transition between one steady state and the next—between Canada’s old economy and the new one taking shape. In truth, the economy is always adjusting to structural forces like new technology. Most of the time structural change is gradual and relatively smooth. It’s operating in the background. But sometimes structural change is more prominent because the pace of change is unusually rapid. This can happen because of a fundamental policy shift—such as the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement in 1989—or the dawn of a new transformative technology like the internet in the 1990s. Today is one of those times of rapid change—we are facing a convergence of structural breaks. Advances in AI have dramatically broadened its application, the United States has swerved to protectionism, and our population growth has declined. Structural change can be disruptive, rendering some investments obsolete and displacing some workers. And spillovers from sectors that are restructuring can create cyclical weakness in other parts of the economy. Structural change can also increase uncertainty because it’s hard to know how transformative it will be. When the internet emerged in the 1990s, we didn’t know just how valuable the new technology would be or which investments would pay off. Even as the internet proved to be an enormously powerful new technology, the dot-com bust of 2000 was a painful reminder that many new companies could fail. Like the internet, AI is a transformative technology, and its rise has sparked concerns about over-investment and over-valuation as well as fears of job destruction. But just as the internet enabled new services and business models that boosted productivity, the rise of AI has the potential to put the economy on a higher path and raise our standard of living. While AI is building on past innovation, the US swerve to protectionism is reversing gains from trade. When Canada embarked on free trade with the United States in 1989, it did bring some pain in the short term—competition can be tough. But, in time, a bigger market and new competition brought innovation and investment, increasing productivity and growth and lowering inflation. 1 Now, new US trade restrictions are reducing efficiency, raising costs and lowering incomes in Canada. Trend growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is also being pulled down by lower population growth, which reflects both a decline in fertility and lower rates of immigration. That means fewer new consumers and workers in the economy, which lowers our economic potential. The Bank’s population forecast suggests the Canadian labour force will hardly grow at all over the next few years after annual growth of almost 1½% on average for the past 20 years. Looking back at history makes identifying structural breaks look deceptively easy. But identifying what is happening in real time is challenging because structural change happens at the same time as cyclical changes in demand and supply. That makes it hard for businesses, workers, governments and central banks to know which change is temporary and which is permanent—and hence where to invest and how to set policy. I’ll come back to the policy implications momentarily. Canada’s economic outlook But first, let’s consider the first question: what does structural change mean for the economy over the next couple of years? Last week, the Bank released its quarterly Monetary Policy Report , including our economic outlook for 2026 and 2027. US tariffs have weakened our economy. Exports are down sharply. And while some export growth is expected to resume this year, exports grow along a lower path ( Chart 1 ). The trade conflict has also spilled over to the broader economy. Business investment has been weak across sectors—largely because of elevated uncertainty. But investment is expected to strengthen as businesses adapt to the new trade environment and governments increase infrastructure spending. Household spending is also expected to grow moderately, supported by past cuts in interest rates and rising disposable incomes. Adding it all up, the economy is forecast to grow—but it’s soft growth. We expect GDP growth to average only about 1¼% over the next two years. Part of this softness reflects cyclical weakness and part reflects structural change. The lower US demand for Canadian exports and trade-related uncertainty has spilled over into lower business investment and hiring. But tariffs have also increased costs and reduced the efficiency of the economy. And lower immigration means less labour force growth. In our baseline forecast, the spillover effects from the trade shock and uncertainty gradually dissipate and the economy recovers from the cyclical weakness. But the path for potential output is lower because of increased trade friction and slower population growth. Turning to jobs, we expect businesses to be cautious in their hiring this year. But with little growth in the labour force, we are not expecting the unemployment rate to trend higher. Indeed, with modest economic growth, we should see some gradual improvement in the labour market over the projection. But structural change means this improvement could be uneven across sectors and occupations. I’ll come back to this. Inflation is expected to remain close to the 2% target. Tariffs and the costs of reconfiguring trade are putting some upward pressure on inflation. But the cyclical weakness in demand is constraining price increases. With the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement under review this year, uncertainty will continue to weigh on the economy. And broader geopolitical risks are elevated. We could see a lot of worrying headlines—and uncertainty makes it hard for businesses to invest. But some things are clear. The United States has rejected open trade, population growth has slowed, and AI will change the marketplace. And when the economic landscape changes, Canadian businesses need to adjust. Recent federal and provincial budgets include measures to help businesses pivot, support workers in the transition and help the economy restructure. These policy measures are included in our economic outlook, along with past interest rate cuts and other announced fiscal measures. As the Canadian economy works through this transition, growth will be modest. In time, the economy restructures and productivity and potential output pick up, but this will be measured in years, not quarters. The transition could be faster than we expect, particularly if trade uncertainties ease and businesses move more boldly to invest in new technology, markets and products. But it could also be more painful than we’d like—particularly if the trade situation darkens or other shocks disrupt the economy. Worse still, the Canadian economy could fail to restructure. If that happens, productivity and GDP growth do not recover. Canada becomes a less attractive place to invest. Businesses become less competitive. Job and wage growth are weak, our incomes don’t recover, and affordability worsens. That’s what we really can’t afford. That’s why we need to lean into this structural change. Structural change, sectoral adjustment and supply That brings me to the second question: Where do we see adjustment already happening? I’ll start with trade. As we approach the one-year mark of US tariff threats, supply chains have started to shift. Goods imports from the United States have declined, while those from other countries have increased ( Chart 2 ). That decline in imports from the United States has mostly happened in sectors affected by Canada’s retaliatory tariffs—we’re diversifying to avoid higher costs. There are also indications our imports from overseas are being rerouted to avoid going through the United States. Increasingly, we’re getting them directly. Exports too, are shifting, though not as quickly. Exports of goods to non-US markets have risen, while exports to the US have fallen ( Chart 3 ). A small but growing share of exporters have increased sales to overseas markets. So far, the increase is largely limited to existing clients—businesses have not found many new clients just yet. And with so much of our exports going to the United States, the increase in other markets only provides a partial offset. You can see this in the large overall decline in our exports ( Chart 1 ). You can also see it in the labour market. Employment in sectors with high exposure to trade fell in the first half of last year and remains subdued ( Chart 4 ). It's still early days. It will take time to develop new markets, and the transition will weigh on our export sector. It is encouraging that businesses have started adapting, but there is a long way to go. The changes brought by AI are not as easy to capture. We’re certainly seeing some AI investment, and we expect efficiencies brought by AI will ultimately boost productivity. AI will also likely affect the labour market, and we’re watching that closely. So far, it’s too early to see significant AI impacts on productivity or employment in Canada. But we are seeing a few early indicators of change. AI adoption looks to be increasing in Canada but remains modest. When we talk to companies, they tell us their workers are increasingly using AI at work. But significant adoption of AI to produce or deliver goods and services remains low. Statistics Canada’s Survey on Business Conditions puts this at 12% of businesses. Our most recent Business Leaders’ Pulse survey yielded broadly similar responses. Only 8% of businesses surveyed reported significant AI use in their operations, with another 11% reporting plans to use AI over the next year. But the majority had either no use or infrequent use of AI. And while AI may be expected to boost productivity at some point, it may be a while before we see a significant impact. So far, we are not seeing much impact of AI in the labour market either. 2 Not surprisingly, we are seeing increased demand for workers with AI skills. 3 The flip side is we may be seeing some early evidence that AI is reducing the number of entry-level jobs in some occupations. And this may be boosting youth unemployment, although separating the effects of AI from the impact of trade and demographic changes is difficult. There are more media reports that professional services companies are cutting back on entry-level positions because AI can do some of the work. And there is some hard evidence that it is getting more difficult to find a job in occupations with a larger proportion of tasks that can be performed by AI ( Chart 5 ). At the same time, we are seeing a decline in the share of entry-level job vacancies ( Chart 6 ). Long-term youth unemployment is also elevated. As we monitor employment through this structural change, it’s important to remember that technological progress doesn’t just benefit companies at the expense of workers. Canadians benefit too. Productivity growth pays for higher wages. And recent innovations have given us more choice for less cost. The internet brought instant communication, e-commerce at our fingertips, GPS warnings of traffic ahead, crowdsourced reviews and online bookings for everything. AI holds similar promise for new goods and services and lower cost. Monetary policy implications With structural change underway and lots of runway ahead, we come to the third question: What are the implications for monetary policy? Recall our definition of structural change: it’s the transition from Canada’s old economy to the new one that’s taking shape. Monetary policy can’t change the destination. But it can help smooth the journey. Let me explain. The Bank of Canada is helping the economy through this restructuring, while keeping inflation low and stable. Monetary policy can support demand that’s being restrained by spillovers and cyclical weakness. What monetary policy can’t do is restore the lost efficiency caused by increased trade friction. Monetary policy isn’t going to have much effect on the adoption of AI either. And monetary policy certainly can’t influence fertility or immigration rates. But what’s clear in principle is more complicated in practice. Several realities complicate monetary policy in the face of structural change. I’ll focus on two. First, it is hard to differentiate structural change from cyclical fluctuations as they are happening. In the short term, structural change is hard to see through the ups and downs in the economy—so it can be hard to know whether a drop in GDP growth is part of a structural trend or a temporary downturn. We have to be careful not to misdiagnose economic weakness. Monetary policy should not try to compensate for lost supply. Lowering interest rates in the face of weak economic activity risks stoking future inflation if the weakness is due to lower productive capacity rather than a cyclical downturn in demand. And there is also a risk that overstimulating demand when the problem is structural could delay needed structural change. Second, by its nature, structural change will affect different sectors and workers differently. We can’t just look at the average impacts. US tariffs are already hitting the economy very unevenly. AI is poised to disrupt some industries and occupations more than others. Experience has taught us that these sectoral differences are important to understand inflation. For example, strong demand in some sectors may boost inflation by more than weakness elsewhere lowers it. Navigating the transition will require a lot of careful analysis and thoughtful judgment. We have to look beyond the aggregate and dig into more granular data to see how workers and capital are moving across sectors and regions. The dynamics of the labour market can offer important clues about what’s cyclical and what’s structural. While cyclical downturns always affect some jobs more than others, experience tells us that cyclical downturns result in a broad-based weakness in the labour market. So if unemployment, job vacancies, separations and finding rates are unusually different across sectors, occupations and demographic groups, it suggests structural change is at play. Our surveys of businesses and consumers will also help identify how capital is shifting, jobs are changing and workers are adjusting. And given that Canada’s main industrial sectors are concentrated in different parts of the country, our regional analysis and outreach will be important. Finally, we need multi-sector models to understand the monetary policy implications of structural change. Since the pandemic, we’ve developed richer models that capture sectoral differences and the links between sectors. More granular analysis, continued regional outreach and richer models will all help us separate what is cyclical and what is structural. Even so, the confluence of geopolitical, demographic and technical change increases the risks of getting it wrong. That’s why we’re using more scenario analysis. It allows us to explore alternative interpretations and reduce the risk of policy errors. And we will be ready to respond if new information changes our outlook. In short, we’ll be working hard to identify and assess the relative importance of cyclical and structural changes. Through it all, our 2% inflation target will remain our ultimate policy beacon. Conclusion It’s time to wrap up. I began my speech by acknowledging the heightened uncertainty we continue to face. This is making it difficult for businesses, families and communities to plan and prepare for the future—but we need to play the new hand we’ve been dealt, not the one we had. Even with increased uncertainty, the structural forces of US protectionism, new AI-driven technology and shifting demographics are unmistakable. How Canadian households, businesses and governments respond to these structural breaks will determine our future prosperity. We can be victims of US tariffs and AI disruption, or we can lean into structural change, expand our internal market, diversify our trade, embrace new technology and raise our productivity. Monetary policy will not be at the centre of the action. But the Bank of Canada will play a supporting role. Our focus is on maintaining low and stable inflation while helping the economy through this period of structural change. And it’s on managing through this period of elevated uncertainty. That means being alive to the risks and prepared to adjust if the outlook changes. Thank you.

Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%. Although above the 2% target currently, CPI inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April, owing to developments in energy prices including from Budget 2025. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease. The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. Monetary policy is being set to ensure that CPI inflation not only reaches 2% but remains sustainably at that level in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this. The restrictiveness of policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. The extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 4 February 2026 1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) discussed key economic developments and its judgements around them, as well as its views on monetary policy strategy. The latest data and analysis underpinning these topics were set out in the accompanying February 2026 Monetary Policy Report . The Committee’s discussions 2: The Committee’s policy discussions at this meeting focused on: the near-term outlook for inflation, and its implications for underlying price and wage pressures; the role of slack in the economy in helping to keep inflation at the target in the medium term; and the appropriate response of monetary policy, taking into account these factors as well as broader strategic considerations. 3: CPI inflation had fallen from 3.8% in September last year to 3.4% in December. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy, wage growth and services price inflation had generally continued to ease, albeit remaining above target-consistent levels. CPI inflation was expected to fall back to around the 2% target from April. This mainly reflected developments in energy prices, including the impact of measures announced in Budget 2025. This near-term outlook was notably lower than had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report, although there had been less news relative to the MPC’s December meeting. 4: UK import prices were also contributing slightly to the projected decline in CPI inflation this year, including as US tariffs and previous energy price falls were weighing on global export price growth. Uncertainty around the global outlook remained. 5: All members of the Committee continued to stress the importance of inflation not only reaching but remaining sustainably at the 2% target in the medium term. Members had different views on the extent to which the near-term reduction in headline inflation, which predominantly reflected one-off factors, would be sufficient to curb remaining risks of persistence in underlying inflationary pressures. 6: For some members, the prospective reduction in headline inflation, particularly in categories such as energy and food that remained salient for households, could feed through quickly to inflation expectations and lead to continued normalisation of wage and price-setting. These members also pointed to pay settlements in the Agents’ pay survey slowing to 3.4% this year, close to target-consistent levels. However, other members were more concerned about still-elevated inflation expectations and a range of future wage indicators, despite disinflation to date. If such inflationary pressures persisted, monetary policy would need to remain more restrictive to avoid inflation settling above the target in the medium term. Most members put some weight on Bank staff analysis that had found little evidence of structural changes in wage bargaining over the recent period. 7: The extent to which remaining excess domestic inflationary pressures would fall would crucially also be influenced by developments in the labour market and the degree to which economic slack acted against these pressures in the coming years. Underlying GDP growth had remained below estimates of potential, and Agents’ intelligence pointed to a subdued outlook for demand. The labour market had continued to loosen, with the unemployment rate having picked up to just over 5% recently. As a result, the February Report central projection incorporated a slightly wider output gap over the forecast period than had been expected in November. 8: Most members judged that there remained some downside risks around this already weaker outlook, which could widen the output gap further and result in an undershoot in inflation, in the absence of looser monetary policy. Households might remain cautious about spending, with a risk that the saving rate would not fall back as expected. Demand could remain weak and unemployment could increase by more than expected. 9: Other members noted signs of a slowing in the pace of labour market loosening as, for example, vacancies had started to tick up. Weak productivity growth could keep unit labour cost growth elevated and contribute to a narrower output gap than otherwise estimated. And growth in bank lending and broad money had both edged higher, suggesting that monetary policy was not overly restrictive. 10: On balance, the Committee judged that the risk from greater inflation persistence had continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remained. In making this assessment, members had generally been influenced more by new Bank staff analysis, including that published in the February Report, than by the most recent data releases. 11: In considering how monetary policy should be set to balance these risks around inflation settling sustainably at the target, the Committee judged that, on the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate was likely to be reduced further, although there were different views on the timing and extent. Judgements around further policy easing would become a closer call. With uncertainty around how precisely a neutral level of Bank Rate could be estimated, slowing the pace of further easing could provide space to gain assurance about how the risks were evolving. 12: Across possible inflation scenarios, the MPC considered how well different monetary policy paths could insure against adverse economic outcomes. 13: Some members were most concerned that cutting rates too quickly risked inadvertently making policy too accommodative if inflationary pressures did not recede, and that it might be costly to change course in that event. If downside risks were instead to materialise, Bank Rate could still be reduced faster then. Other members were concerned that holding Bank Rate at a restrictive level for too long could require a sharper adjustment in monetary policy later on. Finding clear evidence that structural changes had occurred in the economy would always take a long time to become evident in the data. And waiting too long to change policy in the meantime could come at the cost of a sharper downturn in activity and a significant undershoot in inflation. 14: The Committee noted that the central projection was conditioned on a market curve that fell slightly in 2026 then sloped upwards thereafter, to around 3¾% in 2029. Instead, the median respondent to the Market Participants Survey expected Bank Rate to fall to 3.25% and stay there. Members recognised that the upward slope in market pricing beyond this year, even if it did not solely reflect market expectations of Bank Rate, was providing restriction via firms’ and households’ financing costs. The immediate policy decision 15: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably. 16: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% at this meeting. These members recognised that progress in disinflation had continued. While the lower near-term outlook for inflation was welcome, it remained to be seen how this would pass through into wage and price-setting in the economy. For three members in this group (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli and Huw Pill), a more prolonged period of policy restriction was likely to be warranted to mitigate the remaining risks that inflation could settle above the target, but they would continue to assess the evidence. The other two members in this group (Andrew Bailey and Catherine L Mann) had greater confidence that this risk would be mitigated by the lower near-term path for inflation and placed greater emphasis on the risks to inflation from weaker activity, but neither member judged that the weight of evidence was yet sufficient to warrant reducing Bank Rate at this meeting. 17: Four members (Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. These members judged that the risk from greater inflation persistence had receded materially, and thought it likely that inflation expectations would normalise once inflation itself returned to around the target. These members attached a greater weight to the risks to inflation from weaker demand. For these members, monetary policy was still too restrictive, and a further cut in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. 18: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 3.75%. 19: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members (Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%.

References to scenarios relate to those set out in Section 3 of the November 2025 Report, which have been updated in the February Report. Vote to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75% Andrew Bailey: My policy decision is based on accumulating evidence. Despite all the uncertainties in the world, we are not currently facing a situation in which monetary policy is being hit by big new shocks. Activity is subdued against a background of inflation returning to the target. I can see the case for the output gap having widened, but by how much is uncertain. Although survey evidence on activity is pointing to a slightly more positive short-term picture, my central outlook is aligned with the staff’s view of weaker demand, leaving the risks more balanced. The supply side story remains uncertain (Box C). I expect to see quite a sharp drop in inflation over coming months. While I am more confident in the overall path of wage disinflation, it is naturally less clear when and how much the expected upcoming drop in inflation will influence wage settlements (Box B). Overall, the risks from inflation persistence appear to have continued to reduce. I therefore see scope for some further easing of policy. This does not mean that I expect to cut Bank Rate at any particular meeting. I will go into the coming meetings asking whether a cut is justified. Megan Greene: I continue to place more weight on the risk of inflation persistence, preferring to wait for clearer evidence that inflation will settle sustainably at the target before easing policy further. I find it difficult to justify our significant downward revision to slack in this forecast, given year-on-year headline GDP growth surprised to the upside for much of 2025. I also think it unlikely that potential productivity will pick up as assumed (Box C) and put more weight on Bank staff’s smaller output gap sensitivity (Section 3.2). Our central projection requires underlying inflation and wage growth to decline further for inflation to stabilise at the target. I have three primary concerns: forward-looking indicators of wage growth remain above target-consistent rates; firms in the DMP Survey expect little change in their own-price inflation over the next year; and household inflation expectations remain elevated. I would prefer to wait to see that firms and households revise down their inflation expectations in response to lower realised inflation. I continue to think the monetary policy stance is not materially restrictive. Finally, I believe the cost of a policy error is greater if Bank Rate follows the market path and we end up with inflation persistence versus weaker demand. Clare Lombardelli: Overall the data continue broadly to show strength in wages and underlying inflation, weak activity and softening employment. While the near-term fall in CPI inflation should reduce second-round effects, it is not assured that wage growth will return to target-consistent rates (Box A). The recent recovery in productivity is likely cyclical. Structural productivity growth, which has been weak since the financial crisis, may not recover to the extent that Bank staff estimate (Box C). I remain concerned about both upside and downside risks to inflation. The labour market has loosened materially, from an extremely tight starting point, but it is unclear how much downward pressure this is putting on inflation. The current degree of restrictiveness is uncertain (Box E), although evidence on credit does not suggest monetary policy is weighing heavily on the economy. Taken together, I prefer to hold Bank Rate at its current level. I am more concerned about the costs of cutting rates too quickly than too slowly, including the risks to credibility from any potential policy reversal that is not in response to a new shock. Catherine L Mann: New analysis and current developments have moved the appropriate time for a cut in Bank Rate closer. This will partly depend on how various one-off policies (Box D) – which account for half of the projected disinflation between 2025 H2 and 2026 H2 – affect the underlying disinflation process. Wage and price moderation is in train, with one-year ahead expected inflation of income-elastic and discretionary consumer-facing products particularly notable. Some components of CPI inflation have remained above target-consistent rates (Box E), most likely because wage growth is not target-consistent either (Box A). Bank staff analysis on different categories of wage setters suggests that lower inflation should push down on settlements for a significant proportion of private sector workers (Box B). Private sector activity and employment continue to be soft. Consumers have been scarred by high and volatile inflation, which poses a risk to the projected decrease in the saving rate in the central projection. The degree of restrictiveness varies over the time horizon and whether the focus is on real or nominal rates. A cut now would overweight the importance of the near-term mechanical disinflation and risk higher term premia. I look forward to incoming assessments of the constellation of surveys and data ahead of upcoming meetings. Huw Pill: I do not see a need to reduce Bank Rate further at this meeting. This follows from distinguishing between the underlying disinflation process, which remains intact but incomplete, and the risks around that process, which shift through time but have on balance been in the direction of slower disinflation than expected a year or eighteen months ago. In explaining this slowing, I would emphasise the role of structural changes in wage-bargaining and productivity – notwithstanding the conclusions in Box B, where I draw different implications from the careful and important analysis – and a monetary policy stance that has been overly accommodative since the withdrawal of restriction started in August 2024. While I draw comfort about the medium-term inflation outlook from longer-term market inflation expectations and low-frequency broad money dynamics, I remain concerned that inflationary pressures stemming from an overly rapid withdrawal of policy restriction over the past two years still need to be contained and eliminated. In that light, I continue to favour a cautious withdrawal of policy restriction, guided by longer‑term trends rather than short‑term news. Vote to reduce Bank rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5% Sarah Breeden: The significant amount of evidence since December has led to a finely balanced decision. New analysis, rather than new data, has further supported my view that upside risks to inflation have diminished: wage growth is set to end this year at target-consistent levels (Box A); structural change in the labour market now appears less likely to have occurred (Box B); and slack is judged to be a little wider both now and over the forecast. The improved near-term inflation outlook should support a swifter normalisation of wage and price-setting dynamics in an environment of weak demand and labour market slack, as firms and households adjust their expectations towards the target. Upside risks to inflation cannot however be ruled out: inflation expectations may not adjust and potential productivity growth could prove weaker than expected (Box C). But I place greater weight on downside risks, particularly in the near term, including those from an elevated household saving rate and a weakening labour market. I can see a case for taking out some insurance against these downside risks to inflation and think policy should be eased a little faster than implied by the current market path. Swati Dhingra: My inflation outlook is broadly consistent with the central projection, pointing to continued disinflation. The inflation persistence scenario is less compelling given the prevailing weakness in activity and higher-than-expected unemployment. The return of inflation to near-target this year alleviates previous concerns about threshold effects. I expect inflation expectations to reduce once prices and wages have normalised, with little evidence of structural change to the wage-setting process (Box B), especially now that previous cost-push shocks are at some distance. While my central case has the risks around activity broadly balanced, I still find the downside scenario to be a useful exploration of a weaker demand recovery. The impact of weaker demand on slack could nevertheless be limited if the prolonged demand weakness has also weighed on supply growth (Box C), potentially counteracting the risk of an inflation undershoot. But, overall, I still expect monetary policy to contribute to disinflation over the next year. The market-implied path for Bank Rate looks too tight. The costs of making a policy mistake seem much higher on the downside, especially given weak labour demand. And the reverse strategy of holding Bank Rate then cutting aggressively would be no panacea were there to be a sharp downturn in activity and employment. Dave Ramsden: I see risks to the latest central projection for inflation as now tilted to the downside, reflecting the latest evidence and, in particular, the analysis presented in the February Report. Core disinflation is clearly progressing with cumulative weakening in the labour market and subdued activity, consistent with a slightly larger output gap relative to November. This outlook could be weaker if savings and consumption do not normalise, as a result of recent shocks and geopolitical uncertainty, and if there is greater loosening in the labour market than expected. I am increasingly confident that wage growth will fall to target-consistent rates this year (Box A). Falls in headline inflation (Box D) should help cool inflation expectations and ease wage growth further, with little evidence of structural changes affecting wage-setting (Box B). Additionally, productivity growth may pick up to near its long-run trend (Box C). I do not discount upside risks to inflation nor various ongoing uncertainties. However, with my starting point for an estimate of the neutral rate of around 3%, I judge that policy should be less restrictive in order to meet the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Alan Taylor: This is a substantial forecast revision, but the continued drift is more notable. Since February 2025, cumulative revisions for 2026–27 have delivered lower central paths for inflation and greater slack, even as the Bank Rate path on which they were conditioned drifted lower. If the inflation persistence scenario were materialising, the opposite should have happened. This supports my previous outlook, as do other developments. Firstly, inflation is now expected to return to the target this year; some higher-frequency measures suggest we are already close. Secondly, we reach the target much earlier than previously expected (Box D), and falling inflation means that elevated inflation expectations are likely to moderate significantly this year. Thirdly, this is not all due to the one-time shocks dropping out or new fiscal measures kicking in; softer price-wage dynamics and emerging slack also contribute across the forecast period. Together with normalising wages (Boxes A and B), all this reduces or even eliminates the risk of the inflation persistence scenario. I now place even more weight on the central and downside scenarios. If we expect to be at or below the target with significant slack emerging in about six months, a neutral rate of 3% should be in our sights now.

We use it to monitor developments in the economy and to track businesses’ views.","Monthly Decision Maker Panel data - January 2026 The January 2026 DMP survey was conducted between 9-23 January 2026 and received 2,064 responses. Firms reported that their realised annual own-price growth was 3.7% in the three months to January, unchanged from the three months to December. Note that the DMP covers own prices from firms across the whole economy, not just consumer-facing firms. Year-ahead own-price inflation was expected to be 3.5% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points lower than firms reported in the three months to December. Businesses therefore expect output price inflation to slightly fall over the next year, based on three-month averages. Expectations for year-ahead CPI inflation decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 3.2% in the three months to January. The corresponding measure for three-year-ahead CPI inflation expectations was 2.9% in the three months to January, which remained unchanged relative to the three months to December. Firms reported that annual wage growth was 4.4% in the three months to January, unchanged from the three months to December. Expected year-ahead wage growth fell slightly, by 0.1 percentage points to 3.6% in the three months to January. This implies that firms expect their wage growth to decline by 0.8 percentage points over the next 12 months. Firms reported that realised annual employment growth was -0.6% in the three months to January, down from -0.4% in the three months to December. Expectations for employment growth over the next year improved slightly, rising by 0.2 percentage points to -0.2% in the three months to January.

Some sectors continue to expect a modest pickup in real activity in 2026. Employment and pay Employment intentions remain slightly negative. Agents’ pay survey suggests settlements for 2026 to average 3.4%, down from realised average 2025 settlements of 4%. Costs and prices Consumer facing firms see a weakening in inflationary pressures in 2026. Many continue to report squeezed profit margins and ongoing efficiency initiatives as mitigation. Overview This Agents’ summary of business conditions (ASBC) summarises intelligence from the Bank’s Agents considered by the Monetary Policy Committee at its February meeting. The intelligence was gathered in the six weeks to early January. It also includes the outcome of the 2026 Agents’ pay survey, which was in the field from 1 December 2025 to 6 January 2026. Intelligence continues to describe a lacklustre economy. Even though uncertainty reduced a little following the Autumn Budget, contacts’ expectations for real activity have not improved. While some sectors continue to expect a modest pickup in real activity in 2026, consumer-facing contacts and manufacturers seem more pessimistic than the last round owing to rising unemployment and weak demand. A little more spare capacity has opened up within firms over the last couple of months, primarily reflecting weak demand in production and consumer-facing sectors, but business services also report persistently low utilisation relative to pre-pandemic. Employment intentions remain slightly negative. Headcount reduction is mostly via natural attrition, with contacts increasing their use of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to boost productivity and reduce the need for headcount growth. The widespread narrative from contact visits is for pay pressures to ease in 2026. This is supported by the latest Agents’ pay survey which suggests that settlements for 2026 will average 3.4%, compared to respondents’ realised average 2025 settlements of 4%. Consumer-facing firms see a weakening in inflationary pressures in 2026. For goods, this is driven by an expectation of lower food inflation. Consumer services inflation is on track to continue its gradual downward trajectory. Contacts continue to report squeezed margins, with plans to rebuild typically focused on operating efficiencies, owing to weak demand limiting their ability to increase prices. Consumer spending Goods and services sales volumes remain subdued. Most contacts expect demand to remain subdued through 2026, citing rising unemployment and continued cost-of-living concerns. Retailers saw volumes over the festive period as flat to slightly down with any sales growth driven primarily by price. Food performed a little better than non-food, with gift expenditure reported as being well down. Supermarkets continue to see modest volume growth, with consumers remaining cautious about total spend and forgoing treats. Demand for clothing remains slightly negative, with promotions needed to drive demand. Even though furniture and homeware retailers largely report flat demand, consolidation in the sector suggests overall demand is still falling. Demand for white goods remains low and very price sensitive. Technology sales had been growing strongly until the run-up to the Autumn Budget. The automotive market remains in difficulty, with manufacturers having to restrict sales of conventional cars to meet electric vehicle targets, which in turn is leading to consumers keeping cars for longer or choosing used cars over new. Hotels report that occupancy rates remain reasonably high. Pubs and restaurants report continued consumer caution, with customers ordering fewer courses and less alcohol than usual. However, hospitality spending in the run-up to Christmas seems to have been broadly in line with last year, even though seasonal corporate entertainment was weaker. Contacts report relatively robust demand for transport, supported by an ongoing trend towards staff spending more time in the office. Investment Investment appetite remains subdued, with investment plans now more stable but at low levels. Fiscal and wider policy uncertainty remains, even post-Budget, adding to an uncertain economic/demand outlook. References to investment plans being cancelled or postponed have reduced. While uncertainty related to the Autumn Budget has lifted, contacts regard fiscal policy and the wider economic outlook as not conducive to investment. Many plans now focus on ‘essential’ investment, maintenance and catching up on reduced investment during 2024 and 2025. For some, labour costs and skills shortages, and the inherent efficiency gains available continue to motivate automation and updating tech, but others continue to extend replacement cycles and delay investment. Digital spend typically comprises software updates and adoption of AI, rather than hardware upgrades and increasingly counts as operating expenditure. Contacts rarely mention access to or cost of borrowing, or constrained capacity as drivers of investment. Financial pressure receives fewer mentions, although motivation to improve profitability in the near term is holding down capital expenditure for some. Manufactured goods exports continue to contract on last year due to weaker European Union (EU) demand and US tariff‑related disruption, while services export values grow steadily. Manufactured goods exports fell as weaker EU demand, Chinese competition and continued US tariff‑related frictions disrupted trade, though a few firms noted some stabilisation in the US where UK tariffs were comparatively favourable. Chinese demand remains weak, but Middle Eastern and wider Asian markets have held up, and demand from construction, energy, aerospace and defence remains firm. Automotive softness continues. Growth in services export values is supported by professional, IT, construction and energy‑related work. Fewer US visitors have been replaced only in part by lower‑spending EU and Asian tourists. There are reports of diversion of Chinese exports into the UK. Contacts expect modest improvement in 2026 as they shift focus toward India and the Far East alongside expected stabilisation in the US tariff regime. Business and financial services Annual business and financial services revenue growth remains subdued, supported by prices rather than volumes, which remain broadly flat. Confidence is still fragile. IT services continue to grow due to strong demand for AI, cybersecurity and software‑based solutions, though discretionary projects remain on hold. Banking incomes are higher owing to improved net interest margins, and insurance revenue growth remains positive despite premium deflation. Professional services are mixed: restructuring and tax work remain solid, but mergers and acquisitions and property‑related activity continue to be held back by uncertainty. Haulage/logistics are broadly steady, while corporate hospitality revenues are weaker than last year, with Christmas particularly weak. Recruitment demand remains soft, and marketing/advertising revenues have contracted as large corporates reduce discretionary spend. Firms expect broadly similar conditions in early 2026, with hopes of improvement later in the year tempered by concerns around future fiscal policy, weak client confidence, cost pressures and public sector delays. Manufacturing and production Manufacturing and production output remain modestly down on last year, with confidence more subdued than the last round and growth reliant on only a few resilient sectors. Firms report output slightly lower than a year ago as weak confidence, softer orderbooks and higher relative prices continue to weigh on demand. Chemicals, consumer‑facing goods, construction‑related suppliers and capital equipment producers all note persistently low activity. Automotive output has improved as temporary shutdowns unwind, and aerospace remains a key area of resilience, though defence contacts report new orders are slow to progress. Some contacts report pockets of growth linked to renewables, infrastructure and occasional market‑share gains, but these remain limited. Most firms expect output to stay broadly subdued but steady through early 2026, with some scaling back production rather than accepting low‑margin work. Construction Construction activity has weakened further on last year, with housebuilding and commercial development slowing and little improvement expected before late 2026 Contacts report that new‑build housing activity has stalled, held back by weak demand, elevated build and funding costs and persistent planning delays. Commercial development, particularly offices, remains largely paused due to high build and funding costs. Infrastructure activity is modestly positive with schemes subject to delay, while pockets of growth continue in industrial/data‑centre projects, energy schemes and public sector work. Repair and maintenance activity is rising steadily compared to the same period last year, supported by post‑Grenfell regulations. Overall, firms expect conditions to remain subdued through to mid‑2026, with any recovery dependent on lower financing costs, some improvement in planning and improved pipeline of projects. Some warn that capacity constraints could limit the pace of recovery once activity eventually picks up. Corporate credit conditions There is little news on credit availability or demand with weak borrowing appetite still the main constraint, and smaller firms most likely to claim high street bank credit is not available. Contacts continue to describe credit supply as generally good, with high street banks actively seeking to lend, and larger firms raising finance without difficulty. A tail of smaller, weaker‑performing businesses still report pressure from lenders to reduce debt. Credit demand remains subdued as most firms prioritise paying down existing borrowing amid weak confidence and soft investment intentions. High street banks continue to report low borrower distress levels. Insolvencies are expected to remain concentrated in small and medium businesses and largely voluntary. But there are some reports of more late payments, tighter trade‑credit insurance conditions, and rising bad debts in construction and discretionary consumer‑facing sectors. Employment and capacity utilisation Employment intentions remain slightly negative. Recruitment difficulties remain around normal, albeit with some persistent pockets of tightness in some areas. Larger firms are more negative about their employment outlook than smaller ones. Contacts are mainly pursueing headcount reduction via natural attrition, with greater weight placed on technology, automation and AI to boost productivity and mitigate the need for headcount growth. Higher labour costs and the possible impact of the Employment Rights Bill, alongside weak demand, are also causing firms to scrutinise hiring decisions more closely. There are some reports of redundancies, although over a third of those companies visited in recent rounds had already achieved their desired headcount reduction. Employment intentions are strongest for business services and weakest for consumer-facing contacts, with a lot contingent on how the holiday trading period panned out. Reported recruitment difficulties remain around normal on average, with persistent pockets of tightness for some skills and in some locations. Employee churn remains low, reflecting reluctance to move given uncertainty. Contacts report spare capacity has increased over the past couple of months. This primarily reflects weak demand in production and consumer-facing sectors, but business services contacts also report persistently low utilisation rates relative to pre-pandemic. Much of the slack is concentrated in physical capacity, but there are still reports of labour hoarding where skills are scarce. Consistent with this, where Agents do occasionally hear of capacity constraints, they usually relate to skill shortages. Labour costs The average expected pay settlement as reported in the Agents’ pay survey for 2026 is 3.4%, down from the average of 4.0% that respondents say they made in 2025. footnote [1] The widespread message from intelligence gathered in normal contact visits is for pay pressures to ease in 2026, with contacts citing a looser labour market, concerns about profit/affordability, and relatively weak demand. Those with higher expected settlements report these being driven by: National Living Wage (NLW)/ Real Living Wage (RLW), catch-up following previous freezes/low pay awards at the upper end, ongoing recruitment or retention issues in specific areas, trade union activity, and CPI. These messages are broadly supported by the latest Agents’ pay survey. Box A: Agents’ pay survey The Agents’ 2026 pay survey was in the field from 1 December 2025 to 6 January 2026 and gathered 763 responses covering around 1.2 million private sector employees. The average expected settlement for 2026 is 3.4%, down from the average of 4.0% that respondents say they made in 2025 (Chart A), and lower than the 3.6% figure based on the full set of settlements in the Bank’s private sector settlements database. The average expected settlement for 2025 from last year’s survey was 3.7%. Chart A: Pay pressures to ease in 2026 Private sector pay settlements and Agents’ pay survey (per cent) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England and Bank of England Agents. Chart B: More expected to receive a 2%–4% settlement than last year Distribution of pay settlements reported in the pay survey (per cent) Footnotes Source: Bank of England Agents. The distribution of pay settlements has narrowed and shifted to the left, with over 70% of settlements in the 2%–3% and 3%–4% buckets for 2026, compared to 46% reported actual in 2025 (Chart B). And the proportion of pay settlements greater than 5% has fallen from 23% to 3%, consistent with the smaller increase in NLW this year. The shift in distribution is also evident in pay expectations across all major sectors, which are more uniform for 2026 (a range of 3.1% to 3.6%). This contrasts with reported settlements given last year (a range of 3.3% to 5.2%) which saw consumer facing sectors, driven by NLW/RLW increases, receiving substantially higher average settlements than other sectors (Chart C). Chart C: Expected settlements for 2026 do not vary a lot across sectors Average pay settlements (per cent) Footnotes Source: Bank of England Agents. Last year Agents asked firms about the actions they planned to take in response to the, then recently announced, changes in National Insurance contributions (NICs) and NLW, and other labour market policies. This year, the survey asked them what actions they had actually taken. More respondents to this survey said they reduced their headcount, operated on lower margins, and made productivity improvements, than respondents to the previous survey had said they were planning (Chart D). And fewer made lower pay increases. Intelligence since the previous survey suggests the reasons for this likely include higher-than-expected inflation, NLW differentials proving harder to reduce, and union pressures. Weak demand also prevented firms from passing through as much of the rise in labour costs to prices than desired and many had to accept lower margins. Chart D: Many firms unable to enact their planned responses to changed labour market polices Firms’ responses to NIC, NLW and other changing labour market policies (per cent) Footnotes Source: Bank of England Agents. Non-labour costs Cost dynamics continue to support a gradual disinflation path for consumer price inflation. Materials price inflation remains benign. Most contacts expect low single digit increases in materials costs in 2026 and that energy prices will be fairly stable. Imported goods price inflation is currently limited and this is expected to remain the case into 2026, in part due to China’s drive to increase goods production. Most UK manufacturers expect modest output price inflation in 2026. Business-to-business pricing intentions vary, for example haulage firms expect to raise prices by 2%–3% in 2026, while sectors with demand well below normal expect flat or falling prices. Regulated services such as audit are planning price rises to offset wage inflation. For most business services, pricing intentions are for lower increases than in 2025. Firms continue to report squeezed margins, with plans to rebuild focused on operating efficiencies. Consumer prices Consumer-facing firms continue to see a weakening in inflationary pressures in 2026. Despite some volatity at the end of 2025, food price inflation has peaked, and expectations in 2026 are in the range 2% to 4%. Contacts report that costs associated with the Extended Producer Responsibility regulation have been largely passed through into consumer prices; further incremental increases should be significantly less. Non-food consumer goods inflation remains low. Clothing and furniture retailers expect broadly flat prices in 2026. Hospitality and leisure firms mostly report lower planned price increases for 2026, typically around 2% to 4%, reflecting an expectation of more stable costs in 2026 and a continuation of weak demand. Housing The housing market shows slightly firmer sentiment, but activity remains subdued and recovery is expected to be gradual. Estate agents report marginally improved sentiment entering 2026, though there is still little evidence of a pickup in viewings or transactions. The market continues to favour buyers, with supply expected to exceed demand in the near term. Activity remains especially weak in Central London, where higher‑end prices fell sharply last year and remain under pressure, while regions outside the capital expect broadly flat to modest price growth. Rental market inflation continues to moderate, but landlord exits ahead of changes to renters’ rights in England may tighten supply and add to affordability pressures. Outreach engagement Housing, energy and employment concerns continue to dominate households and charities. Many participants describe further sharp rises in the cost of essentials, with energy prices a particular concern in the colder months, and housing costs, especially rents, a pressure point. Younger people and working families cite high day-to-day costs as a major barrier to saving towards a deposit on a first home. Workers and those seeking employment describe a labour market that feels increasingly challenging and fragmented. The perception is that many of the jobs available are low-paid and/or insecure. Seasonal vacancies, particularly in hospitality, are lower than usual, and hybrid working has increased the level of competition candidates face for local jobs. Charities continue to experience high demand for their services, although the demographics of service users has changed with more people facing ‘in-work poverty’.

Four members voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5%. Although above the 2% target currently, CPI inflation is expected to fall back to around the target from April, owing to developments in energy prices including from Budget 2025. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation have generally continued to ease. The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. Monetary policy is being set to ensure that CPI inflation not only reaches 2% but remains sustainably at that level in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this. The restrictiveness of policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. The extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. Monetary Policy Overview The Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) job is to ensure that inflation continues to fall back to the 2% target and then stays there. Monetary policy has already helped to bring inflation back towards the target over the past three years. That has allowed the MPC to make monetary policy less restrictive by cutting Bank Rate six times since August 2024. CPI inflation was 3.4% in December. Wage and price pressures have continued to moderate but remain above rates consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Recent developments provide more confidence that inflation is on track to return close to the 2% target soon but the MPC needs to ensure that it stays at the target. The MPC’s policy decisions continue to be shaped by how two big forces play out. On the one hand, the period of high inflation could have affected the way wages and prices are determined in the economy, creating more persistent inflationary pressure. On the other hand, weaker labour demand and subdued household spending could take inflation below the target. Monetary policy is being set to balance these risks so that Bank Rate is neither too low nor too high. The current approach to setting interest rates, including today’s decision, is based on two key judgements. Key policy judgement 1 The risk from greater inflation persistence has continued to become less pronounced, while some risks to inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. The recent experience of high inflation could still be affecting wages and prices. This could create more persistent inflationary pressure, requiring tighter monetary policy than otherwise. Services price inflation and wage growth still need to fall further for the MPC to be confident that inflation will return to the target and stay there (Box A: Estimates of ‘target-consistent’ wage growth). In addition, weak productivity growth could put upward pressure on companies’ costs (Box C: The outlook for productivity growth). However, other developments and new analysis suggest that the risk of greater inflation persistence has continued to diminish. The outlook for inflation over the next six months is notably lower than expected in November. That mainly reflects developments in energy prices, including the impact of measures announced in Budget 2025 (Box D: Budget 2025 and the impact of fiscal policy on the economy). Lower inflation in coming months should feed through into lower inflation expectations among households and businesses, reducing the risk that high inflation becomes self-fulfilling (Box B of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). And, while wage growth may only be falling slowly, new evidence provides reassurance that structural changes in wage-setting will not keep adding to inflationary pressures (Box B: Heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour among UK firms). While concerns about the upside risk from greater inflation persistence continue to become less pronounced, some risks to the outlook for inflation from weaker demand and a loosening labour market remain. This could lead to a substantial margin of spare capacity, causing inflation to settle below the 2% target unless monetary policy were loosened further. Despite past reductions in Bank Rate, the household saving rate remains above historical levels. That could indicate that households are more cautious following the recent shocks to their finances, and that spending growth will remain weak (Box D of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Labour market conditions have loosened (Section 1.2) and any further weakening in labour demand could lead to a more pronounced rise in unemployment (Box E of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Key policy judgement 2 On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call. Monetary policy is being set to ensure that inflation not only reaches the 2% target but remains sustainably at the target in the medium term. Monetary policy continues to weigh on inflation and activity (Box E: Monitoring the transmission of monetary policy with interest rate-sensitive indicators). If inflationary pressures continue to ease, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further. Judgements around further reductions will become a closer call. As always, the extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. On the one hand, cutting Bank Rate too quickly or by too much could lead to inflationary pressures persisting, requiring policy to change course. On the other hand, waiting too long to ease policy could come at the cost of a sharper downturn in activity, and subsequently inflation, requiring greater policy easing later on to ensure inflation returns sustainably to the target. With uncertainty around how precisely a neutral level of Bank Rate can be estimated, slowing the pace of further easing could provide space to gain assurance about how the risks are evolving. The central projection described in Section 3.1 provides a reasonable baseline for how the majority of the MPC judges the economy is likely to evolve if neither of the remaining risks around inflation persistence and demand weakness materialise to a meaningful degree. Section 3.2 sets out how the economy could evolve differently to the central projection, including by updating the scenarios from the November Report. These scenarios also help the MPC to consider how well different monetary policy responses might perform in achieving the MPC’s objective of low and stable inflation at the 2% target. At this meeting, the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 3.75%. More evidence is needed on how the risks to the medium-term outlook are evolving before cutting Bank Rate further. 1: Current economic conditions 1.1: Inflation Headline CPI inflation was 3.4% in December, slightly lower than expected at the time of the November Report. CPI inflation has fallen by 0.4 percentage points from its recent peak in September (Chart 1.1) and was 0.1 percentage points below expectations at the time of the November Report. The downside news relative to November largely reflects lower food and services price inflation. Despite the recent slowing, inflation remains above the 2% target. That in part reflects unusually large increases in administered prices such as Vehicle Excise Duty and higher water bills. These are currently estimated to be contributing around 0.5 percentage points to the inflation overshoot, based on the difference between their current and historical contributions (Chart 1.3). Food, beverage and tobacco inflation is estimated to be contributing a further 0.5 percentage points to the inflation overshoot. Elevated labour cost growth is also pushing up inflation, particularly for services which tend to be labour intensive. Chart 1.1: CPI inflation was 3.4% in December Contributions to CPI inflation ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Figures in parentheses are CPI basket weights in 2025, which do not sum to 100% due to rounding. Data are shown to December 2025. Component-level Bank staff projections are shown from January 2026 to June 2026. The projection also accounts for expected changes in CPI weights in 2026. The food component is defined as food and non-alcoholic beverages. Fuels and lubricants estimates use DESNZ petrol price data for January 2026 and are then projected based on the sterling oil futures curve. Headline CPI inflation is projected to slow much more than expected in the November Report, to 2.1% in 2026 Q2, largely reflecting measures announced in Budget 2025. CPI inflation is expected to fall to 2.1% in 2026 Q2, a 0.7 percentage point greater fall than anticipated in the November Report (Chart 1.2). That news largely reflects the energy bills package announced in Budget 2025 (Box D), which, alongside a fall in wholesale gas prices, is expected to result in a decline in the Ofgem price cap in April to £1,616 from £1,758. That fall in the contribution of utility prices represents around one third of the overall expected decline in CPI inflation in the first six months of 2026 (Chart 1.1). Chart 1.2: Lower household energy prices mean that CPI inflation is projected to slow much more than expected in the November Report News to CPI inflation relative to the November 2025 projection ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Bank staff’s short-term inflation forecast only extends for six months. For that reason the Q2 ‘Non-energy’ bar represents the difference between the February Report short-term forecast shown in Chart 1.1 and the November Report medium-term central projection, excluding the effects of energy. The ‘Energy due to Budget’ bars represent the estimated impact of the energy bills package and the extension of the fuel duty cut. The ‘Non-Budget energy’ bar represents expected falls in utility price inflation due to non-Budget related factors such as falls in wholesale gas prices. A reduction in the contribution from other changes in administered prices, regulated prices and indirect taxes (AR&T) is also expected to support the near-term disinflation process. Bank staff judge that the overall contribution of AR&T will fall to around its historical average in 2026 Q4 (Chart 1.3). Chart 1.3: The estimated contribution of AR&T to CPI inflation is expected to be around its historical average by 2026 Q4 Estimated contributions of AR&T to CPI inflation (excluding major VAT changes) ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) These data exclude major VAT changes in 2008–11 and 2020–22, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the Energy Price Guarantee effective 2022–24. The diamond includes the impact of the energy bills package announced in Budget 2025 which is worth a little over 0.2 percentage points. Around 12% of the basket is estimated to be associated with AR&T changes. Given the variability of the contribution of AR&T over the past, the long-term average might not be a good guide to future trends. The latest data are for December 2025 and the diamond is for 2026 Q4. A broad-based slowing in other components is expected to account for the remaining fall in CPI inflation over 2026 H1. That in part reflects the continued slowing in wage growth and a fading impulse from the 2025 increase in employer NICs. Continued falls in some indicators of external costs are also expected to support disinflation in the near term. Bank staff project that core goods inflation will fall to 0.9% by June 2026, slightly above its 2012–19 average. Services and food price inflation are expected to moderate to 3.3% and 2.4% respectively, close to, but still slightly above, their 2012–19 averages. Global price pressures remain subdued. Indicators of global price pressures have been weak, reflecting falling energy prices, domestic demand weakness in China and the effects of higher US tariffs. Chinese export prices fell by over 2% in the year to 2025 Q3, which may be partly due to trade diversion, as well as continuing demand weakness in China. This, alongside weakness in euro-area export prices and the US dollar, has meant that aggregate UK import prices have been fairly flat over 2025 and import price inflation is expected to remain subdued. Spot oil prices were around $66 a barrel in the 15 UK working days to 26 January, a little higher than in the period leading up to the November Report. The UK gas futures curve has fallen by around 13% on average over the same period. Indicators of food price inflation have eased. Agricultural commodity prices for items such as cocoa and cattle had surged in 2025 (Box E of the August 2025 Monetary Policy Report ), pushing up consumer prices, but these have since fallen from their recent peaks. Further down the supply chain, producer output prices have been flat since August. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that food price inflation has peaked and should moderate further from here ( Agents’ summary of business conditions – February 2026 (ASBC)). Wage growth has continued to moderate. Annual private sector regular AWE growth slowed to 3.6% in the three months to November, down from 4.4% in the three months to August and 0.1 percentage points below the projection in the November Report. That fall was partly due to mechanical base effects, as strong monthly growth rates from last year dropped out of the annual comparison, but timelier measures of pay growth have also cooled. Bank staff estimates that abstract from volatile movements in AWE indicate a three-month annualised growth rate of around 3¼%. Alternative indicators generally also suggest continuing moderation, though to differing degrees. An estimate of private sector median pay based on HMRC RTI data implies pay growth of 4.6% in December 2025, down from 5.0% in September 2025. The recent slowing in wage growth has brought it closer into line with the rate implied by its key determinants, following a period of unexplained strength. A model estimated on pre-Covid pandemic data suggests that the estimated rate of wage growth in 2025 Q4 can be largely explained by movements in inflation expectations, productivity and the margin of slack in the economy (Chart 1.4). Box B discusses reasons for the recent excess strength in wage growth shown in the gold bars and implications for the wage outlook. Chart 1.4: Wage growth is broadly as expected based on a simple model of its key determinants Contributions to estimated annual private sector regular pay growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Barclays, Citi/YouGov, ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Wage equation based on Yellen (2017) . Short-term inflation expectations are based on the Barclays Basix Index and the YouGov/Citigroup one-year ahead measure of household inflation expectations. Slack is based on the MPC’s estimate of the unemployment gap. Productivity growth is based on market sector productivity growth per head. Values may not sum due to rounding. The unexplained component is the residual. The final data point is 2025 Q3 and the estimate for 2025 Q4 is a staff projection. In contrast to the slowing in the private sector, public sector regular pay growth rose to 7.9% in the three months to November. That in part reflects some public sector pay rises being implemented earlier in 2025 than in 2024. The risk that high public sector pay growth spills over to the private sector is likely to be low, in part because job flows between the two sectors are currently below their pre-pandemic averages. Some further easing in wage growth is expected in 2026 as labour market conditions continue to loosen. The Agents’ pay survey suggests that basic private sector pay settlements will average 3.4% over 2026, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the November Report, and down from an average actual pay settlement of 4.0% in 2025 ( ASBC – February 2026 ). The distribution of expected pay settlements has shifted lower, with over 70% of settlements now in the 2%–4% range (Chart 1.5). Firms reported that current and expected inflation were the most important factors pushing up pay settlements. Firms’ ability to recruit and retain staff remained important, but less so than in 2025, consistent with the continued loosening in the labour market. Chart 1.5: The distribution of expected pay settlements in the Agents’ pay survey has shifted left Fitted kernel density and median survey expectations ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents and Bank calculations. ( a) Kernel density estimates of the distribution of one year ahead expected pay settlements from the Agents’ pay survey. Curves are smoothed representations of the underlying survey responses. Each line shows the distribution of responses for the year indicated. Dashed lines represent the median survey expectations for each year. The latest data are the 2026 expected pay settlements. Other forward-looking indicators of pay growth are also consistent with some further easing. Firms responding to the DMP Survey, for example, expect wage growth to fall by 0.7 percentage points to 3.7% by 2026 Q4, and then a little further in the three months to January 2027. A smaller increase in the NLW should help to support the disinflation process. The forthcoming increase in April 2026, of 4.1%, is expected to have a negligible impact on aggregate wage growth, in contrast to the 0.2 percentage points boost to wage growth estimated in 2025, when the NLW was increased by 6.7%. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that lower pressure from the NLW is expected to reduce labour cost growth this year. Bank staff’s central projection is for a further slowing in AWE growth, to 3.2% by 2026 Q2 (Chart 1.6). The projection is informed by the 3.4% estimate for basic settlements from the Agents’ pay survey, as well as an expectation that pay drift will weigh on AWE pay growth. Pay drift reflects the extent to which aggregate pay growth diverges from pay settlements and can be positive when firms are under pressure to raise pay to retain or attract workers. As the labour market has loosened (Section 1.2), pay drift has turned slightly negative. Firms’ average wage expectations in the DMP Survey could suggest upside risks to this projection, however. Chart 1.6: Wage growth has fallen and is expected to moderate somewhat further Measures of private sector wage growth and pay settlements ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents, Brightmine, CIPD, DMP Survey, Incomes Data Research, Labour Research Department, ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) AWE private sector regular pay shows the ONS measure of private sector regular AWE growth (three-month average on same three-month average a year ago). The DMP expected pay series is a three-month average, measuring pay growth for the year ahead. It measures total wage growth per worker. The other measures capture basic pay settlements which may differ from AWE growth due to pay drift. The latest AWE data are for the three months to November, while the aqua diamonds are quarterly projections for 2025 Q4–2026 Q2. The DMP expected pay growth is for the three months to December. The Agents’ pay survey diamond shows respondents’ expected average pay settlements in 2026, weighted by employment and sector. The Bank of England settlements database is a 12-month average to December 2025. The Brightmine and CIPD data are three-month averages to December 2025. Measures of underlying services inflation eased over 2025 as a whole but edged up slightly in the most recent data. Measures of underlying services inflation have eased over the past year, and monthly annualised inflation rates are currently at around 4% (Chart 1.7). These measures ticked up slightly in the most recent data, partly reflecting a pickup in restaurant and café prices which rose by an annualised rate of 5% on the quarter. In turn that is probably the consequence of lagged pass-through of last year’s rise in food price inflation, which is expected to moderate in the coming months. The decline in wage growth and a fading impact from higher employer NICs are expected to support a further easing in annual services inflation, to 3.3% by June 2026. That easing is expected to be broad-based, with the trimmed-mean measure of underlying services inflation (Chart 1.7, orange line) expected to fall to around 3 ½% over the next few months, leaving both measures slightly above the range that is likely to be consistent with CPI inflation at target. There is a risk that pass-through from lower wage growth to services inflation is more limited if firms seek to rebuild their margins over and above their costs (Box A of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). 39% of firms responding to the DMP Survey said they expected to rebuild margins in the year ahead. But contacts of the Bank’s Agents expect a limited degree of margins rebuild over the next year, mainly reflecting continuing weakness in demand ( ASBC – February 2026 ). Chart 1.7: Underlying services inflation measures have edged up slightly Measures of three-month average monthly annualised services price inflation ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Measures shown are three-month averages of seasonally adjusted monthly annualised inflation. The low-variance measure is calculated by weighting each component of services inflation by the inverse variance of the change in 12-month inflation of that component from 12 months previously. The maximum adjusted weight is capped at twice its original value. Details of the components that have been included/excluded from the Services excluding indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays measure are included in the accompanying spreadsheet published online. The trimmed-mean measure excludes the 10% largest and 10% smallest price changes. The latest data points are for December 2025. Inflation expectations Households’ and firms’ inflation expectations remain elevated. Short-term household inflation expectations remain above their long-term averages (Chart 1.8, aqua lines in left panel). The Citi one-year-ahead measure stood at 3.8% in January, down from 4.2% in October but around 2 standard deviations above its 2010–19 average. The equivalent measure from the Inflation Attitudes Survey fell by 0.1 percentage points to 3.5% in 2025 Q4 but is also above its historical average. Medium-term household measures remain elevated. Household inflation expectations are above the range implied by their past relationships with other economic variables. Short-term expectations tend to be sensitive to developments in spot consumer price inflation ( Rowe (2016) ), however. Consequently, as headline inflation falls in coming months, short-term inflation expectations are expected to moderate towards their pre-pandemic averages, although there are risks around this (Section 3.2 and Box B of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Firms’ inflation expectations also appear somewhat elevated. One-year-ahead CPI expectations of firms responding to the DMP Survey in the three months to January were 3.2% on average, down from 3.4% in the three months to October, while three-year-ahead expectations were unchanged at 2.9% (Chart 1.8, right panel). Firms’ average two-year-ahead CPI expectations in the Deloitte CFO Survey for 2025 Q4 were 2.5%, a little above their 2014–19 average of 2.2%. The own-price expectations of firms responding to the DMP Survey in the three months to January were 3.5% on average for the year ahead, compared with realised price growth of 3.7%, implying little disinflation over the coming year . But firms’ own price expectations tend to respond to realised inflation and so should fall back as CPI inflation falls in coming months. Medium-term inflation expectations implied by financial markets, such as the five-year, five-year forward inflation swap rate, have risen slightly since the November Report. The median respondent to the latest Market Participants Survey expected CPI inflation one year ahead to be 2.2%, a little lower than the 2.3% reported in the November Survey, and to be 2% at the three-year horizon.

( a) Data shown are from the Citi/YouGov survey and are based on responses to the questions: ‘How do you expect consumer prices of goods and services will develop in the next 12 months?’, and ‘And what do you think will happen to the prices of goods and services, on average, over the longer term – say five to ten years?’. Dashed lines represent the series averages over 2010–19. The latest data points are for January 2026. ( b) Data shown are from the DMP Survey and are based on three-month averages of responses to the question: ‘What do you think the annual CPI inflation rate will be in the UK, one year from now and three years from now?’. The latest data points are for January 2026. The DMP Survey data have a short back-run, so no historical averages are shown. 1.2: Activity Domestic demand Underlying GDP growth remains subdued, consistent with weak growth in potential supply and a small drag from past monetary tightening and uncertainty. Underlying GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.1% in 2025 Q4, down from 0.2% in Q3 and slightly lower than headline GDP growth (Chart 1.9). These growth rates are a little lower than estimated potential supply growth, although that has also been subdued in recent quarters. Market sector output growth has been even weaker than underlying growth over the past 18 months, as past monetary policy restrictiveness and uncertainty, in part relating to Budget 2025, have weighted on activity (Chart 1.10). Public sector output growth has been stronger and is expected to remain robust. Chart 1.9: Underlying GDP growth remains subdued, but is expected to pick up slightly Quarterly growth in headline GDP and underlying growth implied by business surveys ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England Agents, BCC, CBI, Lloyds Business Barometer, ONS, S&P Global and Bank calculations. (a) The final data point for quarterly headline GDP growth is for 2025 Q3. The diamonds for 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q1 show Bank staff projections. Underlying GDP growth estimates are from a survey indicator model based on a Staggered-Combination MIDAS approach ( Moreira (2025) ). The orange diamonds to 2025 Q3 show in-sample fitted values of the survey indicator model, and diamonds for 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q1 show out-of-sample projections. The orange swathe shows the interquartile range of estimates from individual survey indicators in the model and values have been interpolated between quarters. Underlying growth is expected to pick up slightly in 2026 Q1, to 0.2%. This is broadly consistent with the S&P Global Composite UK PMI output index, which picked up in January to around its historical average. Agents’ contacts continue to expect subdued growth throughout 2026, citing weak confidence and subdued global demand ( ASBC – February 2026 ). Chart 1.10: Weakness in market sector output growth has been offset by strong growth in public sector output Changes in sectoral GDP since December 2023 ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Public sector output includes public administration and defence, education, and human health and social work activities. Market sector output is total GDP excluding public sector output. The final data points are for November 2025. Household consumption growth has been subdued but picked up in 2025 Q3. Past rises in interest rates have been a major driver of weak consumption growth in recent years, although Bank staff judge that these effects may be starting to wane (Box E). The household saving ratio fell to 9.7% in 2025 Q3 (Chart 1.11), reflecting lower real income growth and a pickup in consumption growth. Initial estimates of the household saving ratio are often subject to substantial revision, however. Despite the most recent fall, the saving ratio remains higher than in the decade prior to the pandemic. A large part of that is likely to reflect past monetary policy restrictiveness. Increases in the effective interest rate on the stock of UK mortgages are continuing to reduce household cash flows, for example, which is weighing on consumption. Past rises in inflation and heightened uncertainty could also be contributing to a higher saving ratio by causing a structural shift in households’ saving preferences (Box D of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). There continues to be little evidence that households are saving more for precautionary reasons, however. While evidence from the Bank of England/NMG survey points to higher economy-wide unemployment expectations, households’ own perceived job-loss risk remains low on average. And, whereas a pickup in flows of liquid deposits could signal that households are saving for precautionary reasons, the mix of liquid and illiquid deposits in households’ deposit flows has been similar to historical trends. Evidence from spending indicators suggests that consumption growth will remain weak in the near term. Retail sales volumes fell overall in 2025 Q4, and GfK consumer confidence remained subdued. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents expect weak consumer confidence to persist into early 2026. Real disposable incomes are expected to continue to rise, although the freeze in income tax thresholds will limit the support to household spending. While further increases in effective mortgage rates are expected to continue to weigh on spending growth, waning effects of past monetary policy restrictiveness are expected to boost consumption growth overall in coming quarters.

(a) Saving as a percentage of total available household resources. The ONS series is NRJS. The final data point shown is for 2025 Q3. Business investment growth has been reasonably robust, although investment intentions have been weak. Business investment was revised up significantly as part of Blue Book 2025 and was relatively robust at 2.7% in the year to 2025 Q3 (Chart 1.12), driven by investment in information communications technology (ICT) and machinery. Recent business investment growth will have been supported by declines in firms’ external financing costs (Section 1.3). And contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that the cost of labour relative to capital has risen, raising incentives to invest in labour-saving technologies (Box C). As the lagged effects of past increases in interest rates continue to wane and some substitution from labour to capital continues, that is expected to support business investment growth in coming quarters. Subdued investment intentions could pose a downside risk to the near-term outlook for business investment growth, however. Investment intentions fell sharply in 2024 Q4 and have remained weak (Chart 1.2). Contacts of the Bank’s Agents note that the wider economic outlook is not conducive to investment ( ASBC – February 2026 ). And while some firms are resuming delayed investment projects, these are mainly intended to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

The Agents’ measure indicates companies’ intended changes in investment over the next 12 months, with the latest available observation for each quarter shown. The BCC measure is the net percentage balance of respondents reporting that they have increased planned investment in plant and machinery and the data are not seasonally adjusted. The CBI measure is the net percentage balance of respondents reporting that they have increased planned investment in plant and machinery for the next 12 months. The final data are for 2025 Q3. Labour market Underlying employment has been flat. Underlying employment growth has been around zero over the past year (Chart 1.13, left panel). That is weaker than subdued GDP growth would have implied, due to cost pressures from higher employer NICs and the NLW. The flash December HMRC payrolls data continue to point to weak hiring momentum, and survey evidence from the DMP and S&P Global Composite UK PMI suggests that employment growth remains subdued. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents report headcount reductions in sectors most exposed to discretionary consumer spending and to the NLW and NICs increases. LFS employment growth rose slightly to 0.2% in the three months to November (Chart 1.13, left panel). Notwithstanding the latest uptick, recent outturns have brought the official measure more in line with the subdued growth implied by alternative indicators as LFS sample sizes have risen. Aggregate employment growth is expected to remain muted in the near term. Survey evidence from the DMP and S&P Global composite UK PMI continues to indicate subdued hiring intentions.

(a) Bank staff’s indicator-based measure of underlying employment growth is constructed using a dynamic factor model following the approach of Doz et al (2011) . The model extracts a common component from monthly survey indicators, capturing comovements across series. The common component is scaled to align with LFS employment growth between 2000–19. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval. The latest data are for January 2026 for the estimate of underlying employment based on survey data and for the three months to November 2025 for the LFS. (b) The latest data are for the three months to November 2025. The diamonds show Bank staff projections for the three months to December 2025 and March 2026 respectively. Although LFS unemployment data have been reinstated by the ONS, they are badged as official statistics in development and the LFS continues to suffer from low response rates, which can introduce volatility and potentially non-response bias (Box D of the May 2024 Monetary Policy Report ). Labour market conditions have loosened further… Consistent with continuing weakness in employment growth, the labour market appears to have loosened further. The unemployment rate remained at 5.1% in the three months to November (Chart 1.13, right panel) and measures of recruitment difficulties have eased. The LFS redundancy rate remains elevated relative to the last few months (Chart 1.14, orange line), although contacts of the Bank’s Agents report that firms have been managing headcount mainly through natural attrition rather than widespread redundancies ( ASBC – February 2026 ). Vacancy levels have stabilised since mid-2025, with a small pickup in the November data. But the rise in unemployment means that the vacancy to unemployment (V/U) ratio, one measure of labour market slack, has fallen further below its estimated equilibrium level. And net additional hours desired by workers as a proportion of average hours worked, a measure of under-employment, fell but remain elevated relative to their historical average (Chart 1.14, aqua line). The composition of the rise in unemployment is also consistent with labour market slack having increased. Bank staff analysis indicates that short-term unemployment has accounted for nearly half of the recent increase in LFS unemployment since its trough in 2022 Q3. Short-term unemployed workers typically move back into work more quickly, so a greater share of short-term unemployment suggests a larger pool of workers that can be absorbed back into employment relatively easily. Consistent with that, Bank staff estimates suggest that the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate has increased only slightly, although there are risks around this (Section 3.2). …and some further loosening is expected in the near term. The unemployment rate is expected to rise further to 5.3% by mid-2026, a little higher than the central expectation in the November Report. That is consistent with the latest uptick in forward-looking indicators for redundancies, such as HR1 notifications and Google searches for redundancies. The margin of slack in the economy is judged to have widened slightly further as demand growth has remained subdued. Consistent with the rise in labour market slack, recent evidence points to a gradual widening in aggregate spare capacity. Survey evidence on capacity utilisation and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts suggests that spare capacity within firms has increased further in recent months. And model-based estimates suggest that the economy-wide output gap has widened modestly (Section 3.2).

(a) The orange line is the ratio of the redundancy level for the given quarter to the seasonally adjusted number of employees in the previous quarter, multiplied by 1,000. Latest redundancies data are for the three months to November 2025. The aqua line is the number of net additional desired hours that the currently employed report they would like to work, on average, per week, expressed as a share of average weekly hours. Latest data are to 2025 Q3. 1.3: Global and financial conditions Global economic activity Global activity has been more resilient than expected. Bank staff estimate that the global effective tariff rate on imports into the US is around 17%, 1 percentage point lower than at the time of the November Report. The estimated effective US tariff rate on imports from the UK remains around 9%. Uncertainty over US trade policy has persisted (Section 3.2). Global activity has been more resilient than expected at the time of the November Report. Bank staff judge that uncertainty associated with past trade policy measures has been smaller than previously assumed. Easier global financial conditions have also supported global activity, while AI-related investment has boosted activity growth in some regions. UK-weighted world GDP growth is expected to have been 0.4% in 2025 Q4 (Chart 1.15) and is projected to pick up a little over the coming quarters as the expected drag from the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty is offset by a boost from global financial conditions.

(a) The diamonds show Bank staff projections for UK-weighted world quarterly GDP growth, and for quarterly GDP growth in China, the US and the euro area. The projections are for 2025 Q4 to 2026 Q2 for all of the areas. The preliminary flash estimate for 2025 Q4 euro-area GDP was published after the cut-off for incorporation into the forecast so the data point for that quarter is a projection. UK-weighted world GDP growth is constructed using real GDP growth rates of 188 countries weighted according to their shares in UK exports. Financial conditions The market-implied path for Bank Rate was a little lower relative to the lead up to the November Report. Based on the 15-day average of forward interest rates to 26 January, the market curve implied that Bank Rate would fall to around 3.3% in 2026 H2 (Chart 1.16). The market curve slopes upwards beyond 2026 and reaches 3.7% in early 2029. The median respondent to the Market Participants Survey expected Bank Rate to fall to 3.25% and stay there. The market-implied paths for US and euro-area policy rates were around 20 basis points higher, on average, over the next three years than in the period leading up to the November Report.

The November 2025 curves are estimated based on the 15 UK working days to 28 October 2025. The federal funds rate is the upper bound of the announced target range. The market-implied path for US policy rates is the expected effective federal funds rate. The ECB deposit rate is based on the date from which changes in policy rates are effective. The final data points are forward rates for March 2029. Overall financial conditions have eased slightly since the November Report. A financial conditions index constructed by Bank staff suggests that conditions have eased slightly compared with those at the time of the November Report. The sterling ERI appreciated somewhat in the run-up to the February Report. Sterling rose by nearly 1% against the US dollar and around 0.3% against the euro. UK and global equities have generally risen despite volatility linked to global technology company valuations and geopolitical developments. Since the November Report, 10-year UK government bond yields have fallen a little and are below the peaks observed last year. Recent Bank staff analysis indicates that much of the rise in long-term yields over 2025 was driven by higher term premia. That in turn reflected global geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about fiscal sustainability, with UK-specific evolving gilt-market demand dynamics also having played a role. Domestic credit conditions Lending rates have generally fallen following the reductions in Bank Rate and earlier falls in term reference rates, which will support borrowing volumes. Since their peaks, falls in Bank Rate and term OIS rates have generally passed through to the rates faced by households and corporates in line with historical experience. Rates on new corporate loans have fallen from their peaks, broadly tracking changes in Bank Rate (Chart 1.17, right panel). Mortgage rates have declined further since the November Report, with some products now at their lowest levels for several years (left panel). Quoted personal loan rates have eased slightly, while credit card rates remain close to recent highs, consistent with their historically slower adjustment and an unwind in spreads which had narrowed during the tightening phase. Pass-through to sight deposits remains low and gradual. Bank lending volumes have continued to pick up, supported by lower lending rates and improved credit supply. Net lending growth to households has continued to increase since November, across both secured lending and consumer credit, although real lending growth remains slightly below its pre-pandemic average. Bank lending to corporates has strengthened, particularly among large firms. And credit availability for both households and corporates has improved over the past year, according to responses to the Bank’s Credit Conditions Survey – 2025 Q4 (CCS). For secured lending, this is consistent with a variety of developments including lenders’ responses to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) statement on mortgage stress rates in March and the FPC’s update to its Loan to Income (LTI) flow limit Recommendation in 2025 Q2. More generally, the FPC’s decision to lower the system-wide benchmark for Tier 1 capital should provide banks with greater confidence in using their existing capital to support lending. As the main source of money creation, the recovery in net lending has supported growth in broad money, which reached 5% in the year to December 2025. Stronger growth in money balances could signal upside risks for nominal spending and the inflation outlook, although that signal tends to be strongest over longer windows of time (Box D of the May 2025 Monetary Policy Report ).

The final business loan rate data are for December 2025. 2: Topical policy issues The boxes in this section highlight some of the key pieces of analysis that informed the MPC’s discussions. Box A: Estimates of ‘target-consistent’ wage growth Wage growth is an important determinant of inflationary pressures. But other determinants of inflation – including labour productivity, import prices and firms’ margins – will also influence whether inflation settles sustainably at target. This box describes an estimate of wage growth that, for plausible long-run growth rates of these other determinants, should be consistent with keeping inflation at 2%. It also provides a cross-check of that estimate based on historical correlations between wages and prices. The results suggest that target-consistent wage growth is likely to be around 3¼%, but there are risks in either direction. A higher estimate for target-consistent wage growth could mean that additional easing in monetary policy is required, while a lower estimate could mean that less easing is required, all else equal. What rate of wage growth would be consistent with meeting the 2% inflation target? Wage growth is an important determinant of inflation, with labour costs making up around two-fifths of consumer prices. But other determinants, including productivity growth, import prices and margins, will also affect inflationary pressures. These can be interlinked, for example higher productivity growth will ultimately feed through to wages, although that adjustment can take time. And inflation outturns can influence inflation expectations and subsequently wage growth. Looking at how the main determinants of inflation are likely to behave in the long run can help assess the rate of wage growth that would keep inflation sustainably at the target. These determinants fit into a simple formula that breaks inflation into imported costs and domestically generated pressures: CPI inflation reflects changes in the prices of imports as well as of domestically produced goods and services, with a lower rate of import price inflation meaning that the prices of domestic goods and services can grow at a faster rate while keeping inflation at target. Domestically generated inflation largely depends on how fast labour costs are growing relative to productivity (known as unit labour costs). And while firms tend to pass on wage costs directly to prices, pass-through is not always one-for-one and so domestically generated inflation also depends on how margins, the share of profits in total revenue, change over time. Assumptions about how each of these other determinants of inflation will grow in the long run implies an estimate for target-consistent wage growth of around 3¼% (Table A.A). Underlying this, long-run import price growth is assumed to be 1%, a little above its average since the late 1990s. Combined with an import share of 25%, based on ONS estimates , this implies that domestically generated inflation would need to be around 2¼% to be consistent with the inflation target. Within that, margins are assumed to be constant in the long run, consistent with a stable long-run profit share. And long-run labour productivity growth is assumed to be around 1% (Box C). Table A.A: Key assumptions underpinning Bank staff’s long-run estimate of target-consistent wage growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) Import intensity data are not readily available on a historical basis, but a simple calculation based on the import share of GDP suggests that the import share was probably lower in the past. The import share of GDP has risen from around 20% in 1998 to around 24% in 2025. This analysis does not assume that the law of one price holds, so other than import prices, no other foreign price directly influences domestic prices. For simplicity, in the long run, capital costs are assumed to grow in line with labour costs, therefore the labour share of income and margins are assumed to be stable over time. Labour productivity refers to measured productivity per worker. Other factors such as taxes may also be important, but in the long run these are assumed to be immaterial. There is uncertainty around each of the assumptions contained in Table A.A, and some of these determinants may evolve differently over the next three years. This would mean that the rate of wage growth that is consistent with the 2% target could be higher or lower than 3¼%. One possibility is that something other than identified supply shocks such as the global financial crisis and Brexit has been weighing on productivity growth over the past two decades, and that this persists such that productivity growth remains below 1% (Box C). This could occur alongside structurally higher imported inflation due to rising global trade fragmentation and geopolitical tensions ( Dhingra (2025) ). To the extent that trade openness is associated with higher productivity, these factors could interact, such that a less open economy results in weaker productivity growth. These developments would raise inflation and require wage growth to fall further to be consistent with inflation at target, all else equal limiting the extent to which monetary policy might be eased further. In another state of the world, potential productivity growth could recover faster than anticipated, for example due to rising AI adoption (Box C). While that should be matched in the long term by stronger demand, and hence wages, that adjustment will not happen immediately. If this also occurred alongside persistent weakness in imported inflation due to subdued global demand and trade diversion (Section 3.2), that could mean wage growth would need to settle at a higher rate to be consistent with inflation remaining sustainably at target. That could support additional easing in monetary policy. What do empirical estimates imply for target-consistent wage growth? Another way to estimate target-consistent wage growth is to look at which rates of wage growth have been consistent with CPI inflation at 2% in the past. It can be difficult to find a clear and stable link between wages and inflation because of the varying contribution to CPI of energy, import prices and other external costs. Bank staff have therefore estimated the historical relationship between wages and CPI excluding energy and CPI services, while separately accounting for drivers of external costs and productivity. This empirical approach suggests that target-consistent wage growth is around 3.1%–3.2%, with an interquartile range of 2.9% to 3.4% (Chart A.1). That is broadly consistent with the estimate presented in Table A.A, although the uncertainty around the empirical estimate shown in Chart A.1 is very large. Chart A.1: There is a large degree of uncertainty around empirical estimates of target-consistent wage growth Fitted kernel density ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. ( a) The chart shows a kernel density of around 280 reduced‑form estimates derived from regressions linking labour costs to CPI inflation excluding energy and to CPI services. Each estimate corresponds to the implied wage growth consistent with 2% inflation, conditional on import price growth of 1%. The various specifications result from modelling both CPI excluding energy and CPI services using different measures of labour costs, such as AWE pay growth and unit labour costs, as well as a mixture of autoregressive distributed lag and error correction models. The models are mostly estimated over 1988–2025. Box B: Heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour among UK firms One possible explanation for the recent strength in wage growth is a structural change in wage-setting behaviour. A machine-learning approach, which identifies heterogeneity in wage-setting across firms and over time, finds little evidence for this hypothesis. Some of the recent unusual strength in wage growth can instead be explained by the lagged response to labour market conditions of firms whose wage-setting resembles collective bargaining behaviour. This type of wage-setting behaviour appears to be much more prevalent than implied by official data on the share of workers covered by collective wage agreements. Given the recent fall in inflation and continued loosening in the labour market, wage inflation among this type of firm is likely to slow in due course, all else equal allowing for a looser monetary policy stance. How do UK firms set wages? At a macroeconomic level, the key drivers of wage growth are productivity growth, inflation and inflation expectations, and labour market tightness. Many of these drivers are captured in standard models of pay growth including the Yellen (2017) equation (Section 1.1). Statutory policies such as the National Living Wage (NLW) can also affect pay growth. But wage-setting practices vary substantially across firms. According to intelligence from the Bank’s Agents, some firms respond strongly to specific labour market conditions in their sectors and regions, while others are mainly affected by national developments including changes in the NLW. Firms also differ in the degree to which collective bargaining agreements are in place, and in the extent to which they make use of performance-related pay. Explicitly accounting for heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour can help to improve our understanding of the determinants of wage growth. For example, some firms tend to adjust wages more quickly than others in response to changes in inflation. When the economy is relatively stable, a model that assumes the same lag between underlying determinants and wages across all firms may account for the evolution of wages reasonably well. But when there are large shocks, differences in how firms respond to underlying drivers may become more important in explaining aggregate wage dynamics. To explore the heterogeneity in wage-setting behaviour across UK firms, Bank staff are developing a new machine-learning model, following an approach similar in spirit to Gregory et al (2025) . This analysis is based on the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which contains detailed information on employer and employee characteristics, hours and pay for over 1.3 million workers employed by 190,000 private sector firms starting in 2004. Bank staff have analysed this dataset using a clustering algorithm, which sorts data into groups by minimising the within-group variation and maximising the between-group variation. The algorithm considers a wide range of firm-level data to identify distinct types of wage-setting behaviour among UK firms. Results based on this modelling approach suggest that firms in the UK fall into four main categories of wage-setting behaviour. Drawing on intelligence from the Bank’s Agents, these four clusters can be interpreted as ‘reputational employers’ and ‘incentive payers’, each accounting for around 10% of private sector workers, and ‘cost minimisers’ and ‘bargaining employers’, each employing around 40% of the private sector workforce. The identified wage-setting clusters differ with respect to some key characteristics. Reputational employers offer higher pay than firms in other clusters, even after controlling for workers’ qualifications and experience. This may be both a recruitment and retention strategy to deal with skill shortages and to bolster their overall reputation. Reputational employers tend to raise wages quickly when inflation expectations increase. This type of wage-setting behaviour is common in the financial and IT sectors (Chart B.1). Incentive payers rely on performance bonuses more than firms in other clusters, and their wage-setting decisions are particularly sensitive to their own staff turnover. Firms in the agricultural and mining sectors are somewhat more likely to follow this model than firms in other sectors (Chart B.1). Cost minimisers employ a large share of workers at or close to the NLW. They tend to set wages partly in relation to changes in the NLW and partly based on labour market tightness in their industries and regions. Many firms in the accommodation and hospitality sector fall into this wage-setting cluster (Chart B.1). Bargaining firms may use collective agreements to set pay. However, this cluster also includes many firms that show bargaining-like behaviour without having formal collective agreements in place. The bargaining firms identified by the machine-learning analysis employ almost 40% of UK workers, which is significantly higher than official estimates of the share of private sector employees covered by explicit collective agreements (around 15%). Pay dispersion within these firms is relatively low, and wage growth tends to respond to both inflation and labour market conditions with longer lags than in other clusters. Bargaining firms are most common in industries with high shares of public sector employment, such as education, health, utilities and transport (Chart B.1). Chart B.1: The identified wage-setting clusters cut across different sectors Prevalence of wage-setting clusters across sectors ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ASHE and Bank calculations. (a) This work was undertaken in the ONS Secure Research Service using data from ONS and other owners and does not imply the endorsement of the ONS or other data owners. The clusters are identified using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm (K-means clustering), which groups the firm-level observations to minimise the differences within the clusters and maximise the differences between clusters. The chart shows the percentage of workers in each cluster by sector. Is there evidence for structural change in how UK firms set wages? Based on the specific machine-learning model developed by Bank staff, there is little evidence for structural change in the characteristics or size of wage-setting clusters in the UK economy. Reclustering the data over subperiods from 2004–09, 2010–19 and 2021–25 finds that the four distinct groups of wage-setters have been broadly stable (Chart B.2). This suggests that the pandemic and the subsequent period of high inflation have not induced many UK firms to fundamentally change their approach to wage-setting, and that the identified clusters tend to reflect approaches to wage-setting that do not vary materially across the business cycle. However, because the analysis focuses on identifying differences between employers, this finding cannot rule out potential economy-wide changes in wage-setting that could impact all clusters equally.

(a) This work was undertaken in the ONS Secure Research Service using data from ONS and other owners and does not imply the endorsement of the ONS or other data owners. Can accounting for heterogeneity help explain persistence in wage growth? Aggregate wage growth has been higher than the Bank’s standard macroeconomic models can account for in recent years ( Forecast Evaluation Report – January 2026 ). For example, the aggregate Yellen equation that accounts for wage growth based on measures of productivity growth, inflation expectations and labour-market slack showed material unexplained bars for most of the 2023–25 period (Chart 1.4). Aggregate models may not have revealed the full extent of persistence, however, as the correct lag structure is difficult to identify in the absence of a sufficient number of large shocks. Heterogeneous approaches tend to capture such relationships better by drawing on more granular data and allowing for different dynamics for separate groups. Across all four identified wage-setting clusters, wage growth has been high since 2022 (Chart B.3). In the most recent available ASHE data from April 2025, wage growth has fallen back significantly for reputational firms (aqua line) and incentive payers (gold line). But it remains elevated for cost minimisers (purple line) and bargaining employers (orange line). For the former, that can at least partly be explained by cost minimisers’ large exposure to the NLW, which has increased materially in recent years. For the latter, it probably reflects longer lags in bargaining employers’ responses to macroeconomic conditions in the face of large shocks. Accounting for heterogeneity by estimating separate Yellen equations for the four clusters and recombining into an aggregate wage equation can explain a greater proportion of wage growth. This is mainly due to accounting for a higher degree of bargaining behaviour in the economy and allowing the wage growth of these bargaining-type employers to react to all variables with a one-year lag, in contrast to the contemporaneous relationships estimated in the annual data for all other clusters. While the disaggregated data are only available at an annual frequency, this approach could plausibly reduce the degree of unexplained wage growth between 2023 and 2025 in Chart 1.4 by about a third. Given the continuing disinflation process and the recent loosening in the labour market, wage growth among bargaining firms is likely to slow. This would be consistent with evidence from the DMP Survey, which suggests that sectors with a relatively higher presence of bargaining firms do not have elevated year-ahead wage growth expectations compared with other sectors. Lower wage growth among bargaining firms should subsequently feed through to lower inflationary pressures. Chart B.3: Wage growth has fallen back more slowly in the bargaining and cost minimising clusters Median annual pay growth across wage-setting clusters ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ASHE and Bank calculations. (a) This work was undertaken in the ONS Secure Research Service using data from ONS and other owners and does not imply the endorsement of the ONS or other data owners. The chart shows median annual growth of regular pay for workers in each cluster. The final data points are for April 2025. Box C: The outlook for productivity growth Potential output growth matters for monetary policy because it affects the speed at which the economy can grow without generating excess inflationary pressures. A key determinant of potential output is the evolution of potential productivity. While measured productivity has been exceptionally weak in recent years, adjusting for possible mismeasurement and cyclicality suggests that potential productivity has been somewhat stronger. Potential productivity growth is projected to pick up to a little below its assumed long-run trend rate of 1% over the forecast period, but there are risks in both directions. Stronger productivity growth, for example due to larger-than-expected benefits from AI, could put temporary downward pressure on firms’ unit labour costs and require a looser policy stance, all else equal, while weaker productivity growth could require a tighter stance. How has productivity growth evolved over recent years? Measured productivity growth has been exceptionally weak on average since 2023. Gross value added per hour worked fell by 0.7% overall between 2022 Q4 and 2025 Q3, although that masks a more pronounced fall to 2024 Q3 and a subsequent pickup (Chart C.1, aqua line in left panel). Adjusting the official measure of productivity growth for erratic and volatile components of GDP and possible mismeasurement in LFS data suggests a flatter path for productivity growth over recent years. The orange line in the left panel of Chart C.1 adjusts headline productivity growth using Bank staff’s measure of underlying GDP (Chart 1.9). It also accounts for possible measurement error in LFS total hours worked , by combining Bank staff’s estimate of underlying employment growth (Chart 1.13) with an estimate of underlying hours worked, which better accounts for estimates of temporary and structural biases in existing measures. This indicator suggests a less pronounced slowdown in measured productivity growth over 2023–24 than in the official data. Part of the recent weakness in productivity also appears to have been cyclical. Bank staff’s central estimate of potential productivity growth, which is informed by a range of measures that account for capacity utilisation, suggests that potential productivity growth has been stronger over recent years than measured productivity growth (Chart C.1, purple line in left panel). Nevertheless, it has been subdued relative to its assumed long-run trend growth rate of 1%, averaging ½% per year since 2024. Chart C.1: Part of the weakness in measured productivity growth appears to have been cyclical; potential productivity growth is expected to pick up towards 1% per year over the forecast period Measures of annual productivity growth ( a ) and projected contributions to potential productivity growth ( b ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The measures of productivity shown are based on output per hour worked. The adjustments in the orange line are based on the indicator-based models from Charts 1.9 and 1.13 for underlying GDP and underlying employment, respectively. Hours worked are further adjusted for estimates of possible biases in LFS data that are used in official productivity measures, associated with the decline and subsequent recovery in response rates across different survey waves in recent years. The estimate of potential productivity growth is consistent with the central projection for potential output growth and is informed by a range of measures, such as filter models and an indicator that further adjusts the orange line for a measure of capacity utilisation constructed with a range of cyclical data across industries. The final data points are for 2025 Q3. (b) The decomposition of potential productivity growth is based on a growth-accounting framework using a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production function, with the elasticity of output with respect to capital set to one third. The contribution from total factor productivity is a residual. What is the outlook for potential productivity growth? Potential productivity growth is projected to pick up modestly over the forecast period to a little below its assumed long-run trend rate (Chart C.1, purple diamonds in right panel). That is broadly in line with the OBR’s latest assessment of productivity growth. Potential productivity growth can be split into contributions from capital deepening (the available capital services per worker) and total factor productivity (TFP). Growth in capital deepening (Chart C.1, gold bars in right panel) is expected to be supported by relatively robust business investment over the forecast period. That is consistent with further falls in monetary policy restrictiveness, as well as reports from contacts of the Bank’s Agents who have noted that they intend to respond to future rises in demand by investing in automation and AI, rather than by raising headcount ( ASBC – February 2026 ). In the central projection, the effects of Brexit are assumed to leave the level of potential productivity 3¼% lower than otherwise by end-2028 (Box E of the February 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Bank staff judge that this effect can explain almost all of the difference between the current estimated level of potential productivity and its assumed long-run trend level. The remaining effects of Brexit on potential productivity growth are expected to fade gradually over the forecast period, consistent with a modest pickup in TFP growth (Chart C.1, green bars in right panel). Nevertheless, potential productivity growth is projected to remain a little below its assumed long-run trend rate over that horizon (purple diamonds). A larger remaining drag from Brexit could mean that TFP growth remains weaker than expected over coming years. Recent empirical evidence suggests that Brexit may already have had a larger-than-expected impact on trade volumes, through disruption to trade in services ( Bhalotia et al (2025) ) as well as to trade in goods. It is possible that any additional knock-on effects on productivity growth will be slow to come through. It is also possible that the assumed 1% long-run trend rate of potential productivity growth is too high. That assumption is informed by long-run filter model estimates of productivity growth and was first described in the February 2019 Inflation Report following outturns for productivity growth that had been consistently weaker than expected over the previous decade. Measured productivity growth has averaged about ½% per year over the past two decades but is estimated to have been depressed relative to its long-run trend by various shocks including the 2008–09 global financial crisis, Brexit and the Covid pandemic. However, it is possible that estimates have overstated the degree to which slow growth in measured productivity has been due to those identified shocks rather than other factors, which could mean that the weakness in productivity growth persists. There are also upside risks to the productivity outlook, particularly if benefits from AI are larger than expected. While cross-country comparisons are difficult due to differences in data sources and survey questions, firm-level survey data suggest that UK businesses may be some of the biggest adopters of AI so far. And AI adoption may accelerate over coming years if it follows the pattern of previous technological innovations, where slower initial uptake has tended to be followed by a period of much quicker technological diffusion ( Rogers (1983) ). That said, the uptake of other technologies linked to AI, such as robotics, does not appear to have picked up much over recent years ( Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) ). There is a high degree of uncertainty around the possible impact of AI on productivity growth. The range of estimates focused on the US economy is wide (for example, Acemoglu (2024) , Aghion and Bunel (2024) and Filippucci et al (2024) ), although the literature generally points towards a positive impact on productivity over a long period. Respondents to the latest DMP Survey expected AI to increase their firms’ productivity by around 0.6% per year on average over the next three years. The MPC will continue to monitor the potential macroeconomic impacts of AI, including on employment and productivity. The strength of productivity growth has implications for firms’ unit labour costs and hence inflationary pressures. If productivity growth is lower than expected, that could put further upward pressure on firms’ unit labour costs, absent a full and fast adjustment in wages and demand (Box A). In turn that could require a tighter monetary policy stance, all else equal. The opposite would be true if productivity growth were to be higher than expected. What is the outlook for overall potential output growth? Although estimated potential productivity growth has averaged below its assumed long-run trend rate since 2024, that has been more than offset by strong population growth, and hence potential labour supply (Table C.A). Overall, growth in potential output is estimated to have exceeded growth in demand, such that a negative output gap has opened up (Section 1.2). Annual potential output growth is expected to be a little below its assumed long-run trend rate of 1.5% on average over the forecast period (Table C.A). A greater share of that growth than in recent years is expected to be accounted for by growth in potential productivity. Most of the remainder reflects continued strength in population growth. Potential labour force participation and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment are expected to be broadly unchanged over the forecast period (Box F of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ).

(a) The data are percentage growth rates. The data for period averages are compound annual averages from the first year to the last year in the range. (b) The data are percentage point contributions to potential output growth. The data for period averages are compound annual averages from the first year to the last year in the range. The contributions may not sum to potential output growth due to rounding. Box D: Budget 2025 and the impact of fiscal policy on the economy Measures announced in Budget 2025 are expected to weigh on inflation in the short term, reducing the risk of second-round effects from the most recent period of higher inflation. The Budget measures are also expected to boost demand slightly over the forecast period. But that effect is small relative to the overall planned fiscal consolidation, which is projected to weigh on the output gap. What will be the impact of the policy measures announced in Budget 2025 on inflation and demand? The Government set out its tax and spending plans in Budget 2025, published on 26 November 2025. The fiscal measures announced in the Budget have been incorporated into the central projection (Section 3.1). The combined effect of the announced measures directly reduces CPI inflation by 0.5 percentage points at its peak in 2026 Q2 (Chart D.1, green line in left panel), leaving CPI inflation close to the 2% target in that quarter (Section 1.1). Around half of that impact reflects the energy bills package, which takes effect from April 2026 and is expected to reduce the typical household gas and electricity bill by £134 (orange bars). The delay to the rise in fuel duty rates until September 2026 is projected to weigh on headline inflation by a further 0.2 percentage points in 2026 Q2 (purple bars). And the freeze in rail fares from March 2026, together with the slightly more generous allowance for Vehicle Excise Duty on electric cars, provides a small further drag on CPI inflation in the near term (gold and aqua bars). The faster near-term fall in inflation following the measures announced in the Budget has not changed the judgement on the scale of remaining second-round inflation effects in the central projection (Section 3.1). That is consistent with the most recent period of higher inflation having not been expected to lead to additional second-round effects in previous Reports. Nevertheless, the risk of greater inflation persistence is judged to have continued to diminish, in part due to the lower near-term outlook for inflation (Section 3.2). The negative effect on inflation of the measures announced in Budget 2025 is expected to unwind from 2027 Q2, pushing up CPI inflation by 0.1 percentage points, on average, between 2027 Q2 and 2029 Q1 (Chart D.1, green line in left panel). The introduction of mileage‑based charges for electric vehicles in 2028 Q2 is provisionally expected to raise inflation slightly in the final year of the forecast (aqua bars) but there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this estimate. The combined effect of the measures announced in Budget 2025 is expected to be expansionary over the MPC’s forecast period, raising the level of real GDP by 0.2% at its peak in the 2027–28 fiscal year (Chart D.1, white line in right panel). Beyond the three-year forecast horizon, new tax increases are projected to dominate (red bars), such that the combined effect of the measures is expected to weigh on real GDP (dashed white line). Chart D.1: The policies announced in Budget 2025 are expected to weigh directly on inflation in the near term and are slightly expansionary over the MPC’s forecast period Estimated marginal impacts of Budget 2025 on projections for CPI inflation ( a ) and the level of real GDP ( b ) Footnotes Sources: Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The orange bars in the left panel capture the estimated impact of the reduction in costs levied on household electricity and gas from April 2026. The purple bars capture the estimated impacts of the measures taken to stagger and delay the reversal of the temporary 5p cut to fuel duty until September 2026, and to cancel this year’s uprating of fuel duty by RPI. Bank staff have estimated the CPI impact of these measures over 2026 and 2027 and have used OBR estimates over the remainder of the forecast period. OBR estimates have been used over the entire forecast period for the other measures on the chart. (b) The estimated impacts of Budget 2025 measures on the level of real GDP are based on the OBR’s costings and Bank staff’s fiscal multiplier estimates. The estimates for 2029–30 onwards fall beyond the MPC’s forecast period and are shown as lighter coloured bars and a dashed line. How has public sector net borrowing evolved? The OBR expects public sector net borrowing over 2025–26 to be £21 billion higher than projected in its forecast at the time of Spring Statement 2025. That follows similar upward revisions in several years since the Covid pandemic. Those revisions have partly reflected the discretionary policy decisions made by the current and previous governments. But underlying revisions to the OBR’s forecast , in part due to economic conditions having evolved differently to expectations, have also played a role. For example, the OBR has made significant upward revisions to expected welfare spending since the pandemic, due to higher inflation and higher health-related caseloads. Underlying upward revisions to the OBR’s forecasts for tax receipts have been much smaller than for spending over this period. What impact will the overall planned fiscal consolidation have on the output gap? Government plans imply a significant fiscal consolidation over the next five years (Chart D.2, white line in left panel), such that the OBR forecasts public sector net borrowing will fall from 4.5% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 1.9% of GDP in 2030–31. That consolidation is expected to be largely delivered through higher taxation (gold, green and pink bars). In the MPC’s central projection, the fiscal stance weighs on the output gap by around one percentage point by the end of the three-year forecast period (Chart D.2, yellow line in right panel). But that projection is sensitive to the assumed impact of changes in taxation on demand. While top-down cross-checks of the fiscal stance broadly support the MPC’s central projection, some bottom-up estimates suggest that the impact of the fiscal consolidation may be larger. The cyclically adjusted primary balance, a top-down measure that adjusts the government’s budget (excluding interest) for the position of the economic cycle using an estimate of the output gap, suggests a similar impact on demand from fiscal policy to the yellow line in the right panel of Chart D.2. It is possible that the tax multiplier used by Bank staff to translate a given change in tax policy into an impact on real GDP is too low, however. The range of tax multiplier estimates in the empirical literature is wide, but the multiplier used in the central projection is towards the lower end of that range. Applying a larger tax multiplier would generate a wider output gap over the forecast period (peach line). The timing of the effects of tax changes on demand is also uncertain, with a range of estimates in the empirical literature. Tax increases weigh on demand indirectly by reducing disposable income, meaning that they may take longer to impact economic activity than an increase in government spending. Sensitivity analysis suggests that a more gradual reduction in demand from tax increases would imply a larger drag on the output gap from fiscal policy towards the end of the forecast period than in the central projection (Chart D.2, red line in right panel). Conversely, anticipation of future planned tax increases could result in a more front-loaded reduction in demand (azure line). Households may choose to reduce consumption today if they expect planned tax changes to reduce their real incomes. Chart D.2: Tax receipts are expected to increase significantly over coming years, reducing public sector net borrowing and weighing on the output gap OBR projections for cumulative changes in public sector net borrowing as a percentage of real GDP since 2024–25 ( a ) and estimates of the contribution of the fiscal stance to the level of the output gap ( b ) Footnotes Sources: OBR, ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The estimates are based on the OBR’s November 2025 forecast. Other government spending includes OBR forecasts for government investment (capital departmental expenditure limit) and government consumption (resource departmental expenditure limit). Other taxes include OBR forecasts for VAT, corporation tax and property taxes. Negative values indicate a fall in expected public sector net borrowing. The estimates for 2029–30 onwards fall beyond the MPC’s forecast period. (b) After each fiscal event, Bank staff estimate the effects of discretionary policy changes on the level of real GDP by applying separate demand multipliers to changes in tax and different types of spending from their implementation dates. These effects are then converted into changes in the output gap by using an impulse response function that accounts for endogenous supply effects from changes in demand, for example through capital deepening. In the peach line, the tax multiplier is assumed to be double that in the central projection. The azure line assumes that discretionary changes in taxes have effects prior to their implementation. To illustrate those effects, in the azure line Bank staff assume that 20% of the impact of a change in taxes occurs up to four years prior to implementation and builds to its maximum estimated impact in the year of implementation. In the red line, tax increases are expected to take longer to impact demand but are scaled to have the same peak effect as in the central projection. The estimates for 2029–30 onwards fall beyond the MPC’s forecast period. Box E: Monitoring the transmission of monetary policy with interest rate-sensitive indicators Restrictive monetary policy has contributed to the disinflation process in recent years. But as Bank Rate has been gradually reduced, a key question is the extent to which interest rates are still weighing on activity and inflation. Tentative evidence from indicators of consumption, business investment and prices that are particularly sensitive to interest rates suggests that lagged effects of past monetary policy tightness continue to weigh on activity and inflation, but that those effects are gradually fading. Further policy easing will in part depend on the speed at which remaining inflationary pressures are expected to dissipate. How can we assess the impact of monetary policy on the economy? Tighter monetary policy reduces activity and inflation through a range of channels ( Burr and Willems (2024) ). One way of identifying the impact of changes in Bank Rate is to compare the evolution of more and less interest rate-sensitive components of demand and inflation. A fall in more interest rate-sensitive relative to less interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption, for example, could suggest that the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness is increasing. Bank staff monitor a range of indicators that are more sensitive to changes in monetary policy than aggregate measures of demand and inflation. To estimate interest rate sensitivities, staff have run local projections ( Jordà (2005) ) of various subcomponents of economic activity on the UK monetary policy shocks identified in Braun et al (2025) . These projections, together with DMP Survey responses on the adjustment of sales and investment to a rise in interest rates across sectors, have been used to classify subcomponents based on the strength and speed of their estimated response to monetary policy. The subcomponents have then been recombined into more and less interest rate-sensitive measures of consumption, investment and inflation. A comparison of more and less interest rate-sensitive components of activity and inflation can only be suggestive of monetary policy effects, however. A wide variety of shocks and confounders could pollute these measures if they happen to affect more interest rate-sensitive and less interest-rate sensitive components differently. In addition, the approach will not fully capture general equilibrium effects of monetary policy on demand, for example through the labour market. These will tend to affect both more and less interest rate-sensitive components and come through with long lags, which makes them harder to discern. The indicators presented in this box can therefore only provide tentative evidence of the extent to which monetary policy is weighing on demand and inflation. What can we learn from the evolution of more and less interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption and investment? Bank staff have identified subcomponents accounting for around 40% of household consumption and around 50% of investment as particularly sensitive to monetary policy. A significant part of the components classified as interest rate-sensitive consumption are durable goods that are frequently purchased with credit. Meanwhile, investment tends to be more sensitive for firms that operate with higher leverage. Interest rate-sensitive components of consumption have, on average, grown at a materially slower pace than implied by their pre-Covid pandemic trend in recent years (Chart E.1, orange lines in left panel). Interest rate-sensitive consumption was particularly weak in 2023, following material rises in Bank Rate from December 2021. Since the beginning of 2024, interest rate-sensitive consumption has increased again, though at a pace that is slightly weaker than the 2010–19 average growth rate. By contrast, less interest-rate sensitive parts of consumption have fallen only a little below their trend since 2021 (aqua lines). That would be consistent with monetary policy having had a more limited effect on this component of consumption. Chart E.1: High interest rates still appear to be weighing on more interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption and investment Investment and consumption components that are more and less sensitive to interest rates ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Braun et al (2025) , ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The analysis is based on quarterly ONS consumer trends data at the COICOP class level and quarterly ONS industry level investment data. The dashed lines show a hypothetical trend based on 2010–19 average growth rates. The latest data are for 2025 Q3 for consumption and 2025 Q2 for investment. Subcomponents of investment that have historically been sensitive to interest rates have grown more slowly than less sensitive subcomponents since the beginning of the tightening cycle (Chart E.1, right panel). This may partly reflect the effects of tight monetary policy via a cost of capital channel, which tend to come through quickly. More recently, interest rate-sensitive investment has picked up, which could in part be due to the reductions in Bank Rate since the summer of 2024. Meanwhile, less interest rate-sensitive investment has been only slightly weaker than its pre-Covid trend in recent years. Other drivers of spending, such as elevated uncertainty following past inflationary episodes (Box D of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ), could also be contributing to the divergence between the more and less interest rate-sensitive components shown in Chart E.1. This type of precautionary behaviour is likely to affect durables consumption to a greater degree than non-durables. Nevertheless, the measures in Chart E.1 are consistent with monetary policy having weighed on the economy in recent years. But the gradual pickup in interest rate-sensitive parts of consumption and investment since 2024 could suggest that monetary policy restrictiveness has started to fade and its overall impact on the level of demand may now be around its peak. What can we learn from more and less interest rate-sensitive components of the CPI inflation basket? Higher interest rates tend to weigh more on some items in the CPI basket than others, consistent with differential exposures to the various channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. For example, the prices of durable and discretionary goods and services may be more responsive to monetary policy because consumers adjust their demand for them more strongly and more quickly in response to changes in interest rates. Broadly following the methodology of Arnaut and Bengali (2024) , local projections of individual CPI components on identified monetary policy shocks indicate that around 35% of the UK CPI basket can be categorised as particularly sensitive to monetary policy. This is comparable to estimates of policy sensitivity of the HICP basket in the euro area ( Allayioti et al (2024) ). Items that are classified as less sensitive to monetary policy include, for example, pharmaceutical products, while more sensitive CPI components include jewellery and watches. The analysis focuses on core inflation because energy and food prices are driven to a large extent by developments in international markets. Both the more and less interest rate-sensitive parts of the CPI basket made significant contributions to the elevated rates of core inflation in 2022 and 2023 (Chart E.2). From the summer of 2023, inflation in interest rate-sensitive components has fallen back. Their contribution to core inflation has been close to its historical average since the beginning of 2025, though there has been limited progress since. Meanwhile, inflation in less interest rate-sensitive components has also fallen back significantly but continues to make an elevated contribution to core inflation. Chart E.2: Inflation for CPI items that are sensitive to monetary policy has fallen and is close to its pre-Covid average Contributions to core inflation from more and less interest rate-sensitive CPI components ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Braun et al (2025) , ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Individual CPI components, at COICOP-4 (class) level, are split into more and less interest rate-sensitive components, broadly following Arnaut and Bengali (2024) and Allayioti et al (2024) . The dashed lines show the average contributions to core inflation over 2012–19. The latest data are for December 2025. The chart excludes components with a large share of administered and regulated prices. The analysis is consistent with monetary policy having contributed to the disinflation process by returning the inflation rate of interest rate-sensitive components of the CPI basket to its historical average. Much of the remaining strength in the inflation rates of less sensitive components is likely to reflect elevated wage growth. Despite their classification as less sensitive to interest rates, monetary policy can still affect these parts of the CPI basket through a range of channels including the labour market, although with long lags. The recent loosening in the labour market is expected to continue to reduce wage growth over the MPC’s forecast period. But if progress on disinflation in less interest rate-sensitive items continued to stall, additional restrictiveness could allow the inflation target to be reached more quickly by temporarily pushing the interest rate-sensitive contribution to CPI inflation below its historical average. The case for further policy easing thus depends in part on the speed at which remaining inflationary pressures are expected to dissipate. 3: Outlook and risks 3.1: Central projection The central projection is based on a staff proposal, which the majority of the MPC agrees is a reasonable baseline. It provides an important input into the MPC’s discussions and policy decision. This projection is, as always, uncertain and the key risks are set out in Section 3.2. Conditioning assumptions The February central projection, summarised in Table 3.A and detailed more fully in Annex 1, is conditioned on a range of assumptions (set out in the Report’s Projections Databank ). That includes a market-implied path for Bank Rate which falls to around 3¼% by the final quarter of 2026, before rising towards the end of the forecast period, and the Government’s fiscal plans as set out in Budget 2025. Table 3.A: Forecast summary ( a ) ( b ) Footnotes (a) Figures in parentheses show the corresponding central projections in the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report. (b) The numbers shown in this table are conditioned on the assumptions described in the Report’s Projections Databank . (c) Four-quarter inflation rate. (d) Four-quarter growth in real GDP.

Chart 3.1: CPI inflation is expected to return to the 2% target this year and remain around that rate in the medium term. GDP growth is projected to rise modestly in the medium term, while the unemployment rate is expected to peak later this year Annual CPI inflation, GDP growth and the unemployment rate ( a ) Footnotes (a) The fan charts depict the probability of various outcomes for GDP growth, the ILO definition of unemployment, and CPI inflation. The uncertainty parameters determining the width of the fan charts have been calibrated to match the historical forecast errors since 2004 and up to 2025 Q2 for each variable at different horizons but exclude errors during the pandemic given its exceptional nature. The fan charts are constructed so that outturns are expected to lie within each pair of lighter areas on 30 occasions, with outturns expected to lie within the fan on 90 out of 100 occasions. On the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions, outturns can fall outside the respective aqua, orange or purple areas of the fan chart, depicted by the grey background. For GDP growth, the distribution reflects uncertainty around past data revisions and future evolution, so that the mature estimate would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 out of 100 occasions. The Committee no longer uses the calibration of the fan chart skew to reflect judgements on the balance of risks to the central projection. Inflation CPI inflation was 3.4% in 2025 Q4. It is projected to return to around the 2% target in 2026 Q2 and to remain close to that level over the forecast period. The near-term projection for CPI inflation is significantly lower than in the November Report, largely reflecting lower energy prices including from Budget 2025 (Box D). Chart 3.2 illustrates the underlying determinants of CPI inflation in the MPC’s central projection over the medium term. The contributions shown in this chart are based on the standard relationships and assumptions used in the Bank’s forecast models, the direct effects of certain tax policy measures, and judgements to capture relevant factors that are missing from the standard modelling toolkit such as the MPC’s previous judgements on inflation persistence (Box F). This approach attributes changes in past and projected inflation to broad economic influences, such as economic slack, that may affect multiple components of inflation. The expected near-term fall in CPI inflation reflects a lower contribution from energy prices, reflecting the energy bills package introduced in the Budget and lower wholesale gas prices (Chart 3.2, orange bars and Section 1.1). The contributions from administered prices and the pass-through of NICs-related costs are also assumed to dissipate in 2026 Q2 (azure bars and Section 1.1). The contribution from import prices declines over the course of the year (aqua bars) in part due to the expected effects of trade diversion weighing on world export prices (Sections 1.1 and 3.2). In the medium term, these factors make little contribution to the deviation of inflation from the 2% target, although the introduction of mileage‑based charges for electric vehicles is provisionally expected to raise inflation slightly in the final year of the forecast (azure bars). Chart 3.2: Inflation is expected to slow sharply in 2026 Q2 and to be close to the target over the remainder of the forecast Percentage point deviation from the 2% inflation target ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) ‘Administered prices, NICs, and electric vehicle (EV) mileage charge’ includes the estimated direct effects of changes to Vehicle Excise Duty, bus fares, VAT on school fees, and water charges. The NICs component represents Bank staff’s allowance for the effects of the recent increase in employers NICs on CPI inflation. The EV mileage charge component relates to the mileage-based charge on electric vehicles announced in Budget 2025. The ‘Energy budget measures’ bars represent the estimated direct effects of the energy bills package and the extension of the fuel duty freeze. The ‘Import prices’ bars includes an MPC judgement on the price of tradables ( May 2024 Monetary Policy Report ) which has little effect on the profile beyond 2026. The ‘Other’ bars represent other deviations of inflation not attributable to the listed influences including the estimated effects of changes to tobacco and vaping products duties. The restrictive stance of monetary policy, both currently and over recent years, is helping to bring inflation back to target. This policy stance has contributed to the economy operating with a margin of spare capacity, which over time weighs on domestic inflationary pressures (Chart 3.2, green bars). Monetary policy is acting against second-round effects in wage- and price-setting related to the 2022 peak in inflation. To capture these effects, whereby elevated CPI inflation at that time contributed to higher inflation expectations and in turn higher wage growth and inflationary pressures, the MPC introduced a judgement that estimated the extent of these additional effects (Chart 3.2, purple bars), including an assumption that they would unwind more slowly than they emerged (Section 5.3 of the Forecast Evaluation Report – January 2026 ). Over the forecast period, the impact of restrictive monetary policy is projected to continue acting against the remaining second-round effects in price- and wage-setting, such that these effects fade and then dissipate by end-2027 (Chart 3.2, purple bars). The margin of slack widens a little further in the near term, which, together with a fall in inflation expectations alongside headline inflation, supports a normalisation in wage-setting. Wage growth is projected to be slightly above its fundamental drivers over much of the first half of the forecast, based on the expected outlook for productivity (Box C), short-term inflation expectations and economic slack (Chart 3.3). The wage growth projection takes some signal from the Agents’ pay survey, which points to wage growth a little above what these fundamentals would imply in 2026 (Section 1.1). Over the second half of the forecast, pay growth is projected to move broadly in line with fundamentals and averages a little under 3%. Wage growth is close to estimated target-consistent levels throughout the forecast (Box A). Chart 3.3: Wage growth continues to moderate over the forecast Projections for private sector regular average weekly earnings four-quarter growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., Citigroup, ONS, YouGov and Bank calculations. (a) The shaded area represents a range of projections from three statistical models of nominal private sector regular average weekly earnings growth, including a wage equation based on Yellen (2017) , a wage equation based on Haldane (2018) and a simple error-correction model based on productivity, inflation expectations and slack in the labour market as embodied in the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the estimated medium-term equilibrium rate. The projections are dynamic, multi-step ahead forecasts beginning at a point within the models’ estimation periods and are sensitive to data revisions, which can lead to changes in the range over the past as well as over the forecast period. Activity Four-quarter UK GDP growth is projected to strengthen over the forecast period, to around 1.9% by the final year of the forecast. This partly reflects the gradual easing of monetary policy restrictiveness to date, as well as the further easing implied by the market path for interest rates. The pickup in GDP growth is accounted for primarily by a recovery in annual household consumption growth to a little over 2% by the end of the forecast period. Underpinning this is an expected fall in the saving ratio from just under 10% in 2025 Q4 to around 7½%. Accommodative financial conditions and increasing support from the housing market are also expected to support activity over the forecast period. Housing investment is expected to grow relatively strongly in 2027 and 2028, in part reflecting a positive impact from planning reforms (Section 1 of the May 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Global growth has been resilient over 2025, and is expected to continue at a steady pace over the forecast. Supportive global financial conditions and a waning impact on growth from tariffs and trade policy uncertainty is expected to support demand for UK exports. These factors more than offset an increasing drag on demand from fiscal policy over the forecast (Box D). Government spending growth is nonetheless expected to increase somewhat before easing back in 2028. The degree of slack present in the economy, which is currently estimated to be around 1% of GDP, widens a little further over the course of 2026, before starting to narrow as GDP growth outpaces supply growth (Box C). A small margin of spare capacity is projected to remain at the end of the forecast period. Compared with the November Report, there is a slightly greater degree of spare capacity throughout the forecast period. This in part reflects a judgement to take a signal from recent weaker-than-expected readings on the labour market and on capacity utilisation. The labour market has continued to loosen as subdued growth in output has fed through to weaker labour demand (Section 1.2). The unemployment rate is projected to peak in the second half of 2026, at around 5¼%, before declining gradually. Unemployment remains above Bank staff’s assumed medium-term equilibrium rate by the end of the forecast period, though there is uncertainty surrounding this estimate (Section 3.2). 3.2: Risks and sensitivities This section explores the risks to the economic outlook, including the possibility that a higher or lower future path for Bank Rate may be required for inflation to remain at the 2% target sustainably. The section contains an updated assessment of the two scenarios included in the November 2025 Report and sensitivity analysis of the implications for inflation of risks around the current size of the output gap, with the related illustrative policy simulations set out in Annex 2. Risks around structural change in the economy There remains a risk that structural changes in the labour market will keep wage growth above target-consistent rates. Wage growth has continued to moderate over the past year and is expected to fall further as the labour market loosens and headline inflation falls (Section 1). But forward-looking wage indicators including the DMP and Agents’ pay surveys suggest wage growth could remain more elevated. There is a risk that recent years’ large supply shocks have led to lasting changes in wage and price-setting behaviour, resulting in increased real wage resistance and a higher medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate, also known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), which in the central projection is expected to be around 4¾% in three years. If the NAIRU is higher, wage growth may fall more slowly than expected in the central projection. Evidence from clustering analysis of the ways that firms set wages suggests that firms’ wage-setting behaviour has been little changed over recent years (Box B). The analysis also finds that the share of workers whose wages are set in a way that is consistent with collective bargaining-type behaviour appears to be around twice the share of workers who are members of a union. Incorporating this finding into models helps explain why wage growth has typically been higher than expected over recent years and suggests that there is less risk that there has been an unidentified structural change in the labour market. However, last year’s increase in employer NICs could have resulted in a reduction in effective labour supply (Box F of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). The flow of workers leaving payrolled employment has been relatively larger for sectors that are more exposed to the rise in NICs, consistent with a large negative impact on employment in the DMP Survey. There is also a risk that other factors may have led to structural changes in the labour market, including changes in the incidence of long-term sickness, changes in the National Living Wage and developments in public sector wages. The rate of wage growth that is consistent with inflation at target could be higher or lower depending on the outlook for productivity growth. The inflation target-consistent rate of wage growth depends on a range of factors including import price inflation, productivity growth and firms’ average margins (Box A). There is uncertainty around how these factors will evolve. In particular, there are risks in both directions around future productivity growth (Box C). On one side, new technology, particularly AI, could boost productivity growth as it is adopted by businesses. In that case, wages could rise more quickly without preventing inflation settling sustainably at the target. On the other side, it is possible that something other than previously identified supply shocks such as the global financial crisis and Brexit has been slowing productivity growth over the past two decades, and that this persists such that the longer-term trend in productivity growth remains weak. All else equal then, wages would need to rise more slowly for inflation to return to target sustainably. Risks from inflation expectations Elevated inflation expectations continue to pose a risk that inflationary pressures will remain more persistent, but as inflation is now expected to fall back to around the 2% target in coming months that risk may be receding. Inflation expectations have remained elevated recently (Section 1.1). And past evidence has highlighted the importance of elevated inflation expectations for wage and price-setting (Box B of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). A scenario in the November 2025 Report explored how past high inflation could continue to affect wage and price-setting in the medium term through inflation expectations. Bank staff have updated that scenario to incorporate data published since then and the new central projection. In this updated scenario, inflation settles above the 2% target under the latest market curve, as it did in the November Report (Annex 2). This is because inflation expectations have remained elevated and could be suggesting additional upward pressure on wages and prices. The projected fall in inflation in coming months should lead inflation expectations to fall back, which in turn should help lessen the risks highlighted in the scenario. Inflation expectations, particularly for households, tend to move in line with inflation outturns over time. This is particularly likely to be the case as the inflation rate of salient products such as energy and food are expected to fall. In addition, the lower near-term inflation outlook should reduce the risk of threshold effects in inflation dynamics (Box C of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Inflation returning to around the target may therefore lessen the risks incorporated in the scenario. Nonetheless, developments in inflation expectations are uncertain. Households’ and firms’ recent experience of high inflation may make them less responsive to falling inflation outturns than might be expected based on historical relationships. In this case inflation expectations could remain elevated, as they do in the scenario. As was the case in the November Report, the set of mechanical policy rules under this scenario generally suggests that Bank Rate would need to be somewhat higher than in the equivalent rules under the central projection (Annex 2). The specific response from those policy rules results from the need to manage a trade-off between persistently above-target inflation and excess spare capacity in the economy. As was the case in November, the MPC would be likely to need to implement an even more restrictive monetary policy response than suggested by these rules to prevent an extended period of above-target inflation. As outlined in Annex 2, each policy rule uses different macroeconomic indicators and weights, leading to a range of different implied future paths for Bank Rate. Risks from consumption and labour demand There is a risk that household consumption growth will be slower than anticipated. The household saving ratio fell by 0.7 percentage points in 2025 Q3, driven by a fall in real household disposable income while real consumption grew modestly. But the saving ratio nevertheless remains above previous averages (Section 1.2). There is a risk that households’ consumption and saving behaviour has changed such that the saving ratio remains elevated, which means consumption could contribute less to demand. The November 2025 Report explored one potential manifestation of this risk using a scenario calibrated to assume a higher level of household risk aversion, accounting for around one third of the rise in the household saving ratio since 2022. An updated version of this scenario incorporating data developments since November and the new central projection results in inflation falling swiftly and remaining below target throughout the next three years under the market path for interest rates (Annex 2). These results are similar to those shown in the November Report, with the saving ratio staying broadly constant over the next few years rather than declining steadily, consumption growth being slower than in the central projection and the output gap widening by more. The set of mechanical policy rules under this scenario, with the exception of the forward-looking first-difference rule, suggests that Bank Rate would need to be reduced from its current level (Annex 2). An overall looser stance than implied by the market curve would probably be required to prevent inflation falling persistently below target. There is a risk that labour demand will be weaker than anticipated and lead to higher unemployment. Labour demand has remained weak over recent quarters and there is a risk that unemployment continues to rise beyond the near-term peak currently expected. There are some indications that redundancies are rising (Section 1.2). Intelligence from the Bank’s Agents suggests that businesses have grown more cautious about new hiring. And the recent rise in unemployment has been concentrated among the youngest age groups. Employment downturns have historically tended to emerge first among younger cohorts, meaning that these developments could be signalling a greater-than-anticipated weakening in labour demand. Weaker-than-expected labour demand may have greater consequences for unemployment when the economy is operating on a flat section of the Beveridge curve, as is currently the case. This means that changes to labour demand will tend to be associated with larger movements in unemployment (Box E of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). Furthermore, historically there have been relatively few periods in which unemployment has risen slowly. Instead, it tends to be the case that there are turning points where unemployment rises quickly. Risks around the current level of spare capacity There is uncertainty over the current level of spare capacity in the economy, which would mean current inflationary pressures are stronger or weaker than embodied in the central projection. Some of the risks highlighted above would be associated with a different amount of spare capacity in the economy than is currently estimated in the central projection. For example, if there have been structural changes in the labour market such that labour supply is lower than assumed, that would mean that there is less spare capacity in the labour market. In contrast, if potential productivity growth has already been faster as a result of AI technology, there may be more spare capacity in the economy. There is a range of signals on the level of the output gap from different macroeconomic indicators. Persistently high domestic inflationary pressure and wage growth could be consistent with there being little spare capacity in the economy, but measures of capacity utilisation within firms and rising unemployment suggest that there could be significant spare capacity. The left panel of Chart 3.4 shows model-based estimates of the current level of the output gap, as well as the output gap in the central projection which synthesises evidence from these models and bottom-up analysis. These models are consistent with current spare capacity in the economy being within a range of around 0.5 percentage points around the central projection of around 1% of potential GDP. The right panel of Chart 3.4 uses a sensitivity analysis drawing on the relationships underlying the Bank’s COMPASS model to illustrate how uncertainty about the output gap generates uncertainty about the medium-term inflation outlook. If there were 0.5 percentage points more or less spare capacity over the forecast period, then inflation would tend to be around 0.2 percentage points lower or higher each year, holding interest rates in line with the market path of interest rates. These sensitivities are calculated based on a simple change in the output gap and use the model’s Phillips curve estimate, rather than separately modelled changes in components of supply and demand. Nevertheless, the results are similar to alternative estimates based on such changes, for example if there were a different level of the NAIRU. Chart 3.4: The range of output gap estimates is consistent with differences in the inflation outlook Output gap estimates, per cent of potential GDP (left panel) and estimated sensitivity of future inflation to a persistent change in the output gap level (right panel) ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) The production function filter is an unobserved components model which integrates a multivariate ﬁlter approach with a Cobb-Douglas production function, following Toth (2021) . The output gap filter is a dynamic factor model-based estimate of the common cyclical component of GDP (including select GDP expenditure components), labour market indicators, capacity utilisation, wage growth, and inflation, following Jarociński and Lenza (2018) . The dynamic factor model is a data driven model that is less reliant on economic assumptions; it is based on 13 cyclical indicators covering labour market tightness, capacity utilisation, wages and inflation. In the sensitivity with more spare capacity, mechanical policy rules generally suggest that Bank Rate would need to be reduced from its current level and by more so than in the central projection (Chart 3.5, left panel). This is because greater spare capacity also pushes down on inflation. In contrast, when there is less spare capacity, the policy rules generally suggest Bank Rate would be closer to the market curve used in the central projection, albeit slightly higher (Chart 3.5, right panel). This is because a higher path for Bank Rate would be required to dampen the inflationary pressures generated by the smaller degree of spare capacity. Chart 3.5: A greater degree of spare capacity would imply a lower path for Bank Rate, while a smaller degree of spare capacity would imply a slightly higher path for Bank Rate, based on mechanical policy rules Bank Rate levels implied by select monetary policy rules under the central projection and assuming alternative paths for the output gap ( a ) Footnotes Source: Bank of England. (a) Annex 2 provides additional detail on the definition of the policy rules shown here and the equivalent paths for the output gap and inflation. These should not be interpreted as a prescription for how policy is likely to evolve. Risks around the restrictiveness of the monetary policy stance The degree to which the current monetary policy stance is restrictive is uncertain. One way to assess whether the current level of Bank Rate is restrictive is to compare it to an estimate of the neutral rate. The neutral rate, or equilibrium real interest rate, can be defined as the time-varying real interest rate that, if the economy started from a position of no output gap and inflation at target, would sustain output at potential and inflation at target. Overall, the evidence suggests that current monetary policy remains somewhat restrictive but, as Bank Rate has been reduced over recent quarters towards the neutral rate, it is becoming harder to judge exactly the extent of restrictiveness where small numbers are involved. Meanwhile, past higher levels of Bank Rate are continuing to reduce demand in the economy because of lags in transmission (Section 3.1). Updated Bank staff models of the gap between Bank Rate and the neutral rate (Box A of the August 2025 Monetary Policy Report ) suggest that there is currently a small positive real interest rate gap, ranging from around 0–1 percentage point (Chart 3.6, aqua and orange bars). That accords broadly with evidence from macroeconomic indicators of the monetary policy transmission mechanism (Box E). Chart 3.6: Models generally suggest that the current stance of monetary policy remains restrictive, although this is uncertain Average real interest rate gaps in February 2026 ( a ) Footnotes Sources: Bank of England, Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey, Bank of England Market Participants Survey (MaPS), Bloomberg Finance L.P., Consensus Economics, Davis et al (2024) , DMP Survey, ONS, TradeWeb FTSE Gilt Closing Data and Bank calculations. (a) All measures of the real interest rate gap presented in this chart show the implied degree of monetary policy restrictiveness over a three-year horizon. The macroeconomic models range is produced using estimates from a dynamic semi-structural investment-saving curve model and one of the main models underlying the central projection in this Report ( Albuquerque et al (2025) ). The macrofinancial model range is estimated using the state-space model from Davis et al (2024) , with a 95% confidence interval applied around the central estimates of the neutral rate. The financial markets range uses estimates of the nominal neutral rate derived from five term-premia models: the benchmark and survey models in Malik and Meldrum (2016) , Vlieghe (2016) , Andreasen and Meldrum (2015) and Meldrum and Roberts-Sklar (2015) . These estimates are adjusted by average six-year to 10-year inflation expectations from half-year Consensus surveys to obtain real neutral rate estimates. The real policy rates in the financial markets ranges are calculated as the average instantaneous forward OIS curves over three-year horizons, deflated by annual Consensus survey inflation expectations over this period. These inflation expectations are linearly interpolated over the three-year horizon. The instantaneous forward OIS curves are estimated using the average paths for interest rates in the 15 UK working days to 26 January 2026, on which the baseline projections for the February Report are conditioned. The DMP range is based on the difference between DMP respondents’ nominal one year ahead Bank Rate expectation relative to their three-year ahead Bank Rate expectation (which is assumed to match their perception of the neutral rate), adjusted by their expectation for CPI inflation over the same periods. The range shows the 10th–90th percentile of perceptions and the data were collected between November 2025 and January 2026. Some alternative indicators suggest that monetary policy may no longer be restrictive. Financial market derived measures of the real interest rate gap, MaPS and the DMP Survey all provide a wide range of estimates of the real rate gap (Chart 3.6). These ranges are wide enough that it is possible that Bank Rate may be around neutral or slightly accommodative, although these results are sensitive to the definition of inflation expectations used, and financial market contacts generally consider the current level of Bank Rate to be restrictive. Global shocks Global risks remain elevated. One area of continued uncertainty has been around global trade policy. Bank staff analysis suggests that the impacts of past increases in US tariffs, and the associated trade policy uncertainty, on global GDP have so far been smaller than expected. There remains a risk that the US government raises some tariff rates further in the future. And there are risks that heightened trade policy uncertainty has larger effects on the UK and global economy, for example by depressing businesses’ investment and via financial markets. Longer-term impacts on global productivity growth from greater global trade restrictions may also be larger, for example through less efficient allocation of activity. There is also uncertainty over the extent to which trade policy changes are affecting global export prices and to what extent this is reflected in UK import prices. There is indicative evidence that US tariffs have led to slower growth in export prices among countries more exposed to the new tariffs, particularly China since March 2025 ( Garofalo and Prayer (2026) ). This could be consistent with these countries facing reduced demand for their exports. UK import prices moved broadly in line with global export prices over 2025. If tariffs continue to slow global export price growth, that could reduce inflationary pressure in the UK, although the magnitude of this effect remains uncertain. Geopolitical developments also continue to create substantial uncertainty around the outlook for energy prices. Optimism about AI technology has boosted financial markets in recent years. If the benefits of this technology are lower than expected, this could reduce UK GDP. New AI technologies have increased global GDP growth, with the US particularly affected. This has been through increased investment, and by raising financial market asset prices. If the productivity and commercial benefits of AI technology are smaller than expected, that is likely to result in lower global investment, reducing global GDP. As the UK is not a main exporter of AI-related equipment, the UK impact should be limited. The UK economy would be more exposed through the effect on equity prices. If US stock markets fall after a reassessment of the value of AI, that would be likely to spillover into a fall in UK equity prices, with potential knock-on effects on other financial assets. That would lower the value of assets held by UK households and businesses, reducing consumption and investment. Given the fact that AI investment has been financed predominantly through cash and equity to date, the FPC considers that that currently limits the likelihood of severe systemic risk implications from a market revaluation of the benefits of AI (Box C of the December 2025 Financial Stability Report ). In general, to the extent that tail risk type events do not significantly affect the current balance of risks in the economy, it is unlikely to be effective for monetary policy to respond pre-emptively, particularly if the probability or impact of the shock occurring is unaffected by the monetary policy stance. Box F: Insights from the Forecast Evaluation Report Analysis of forecast performance is important to help identify strengths in, and opportunities to build on, the MPC’s understanding of the economy. The recently published Forecast Evaluation Report finds that the Bank’s forecasts have performed at least as well as external forecasters and model-based approaches over time. It also sets out some areas for improvement in the Bank’s standard models, highlighting the importance of drawing on a wide range of models and analytical inputs when setting monetary policy. The role of the Bank’s forecasts in the MPC’s policy framework has been evolving ( Bernanke (2024) and Dhami et al (2025) ), but they remain an important element of the wider range of inputs into the MPC’s policy decisions. Evaluating how the Bank’s forecasts have performed as predictors of economic outcomes is therefore important to help identify strengths and areas for improvement in the MPC’s understanding of the economy. The Bank recently published its first Forecast Evaluation Report (FER), with approaches underpinned by a new forecast evaluation toolkit ( Abiry et al (2026) and Bank of England GitHub ). The Report in part responds to Bernanke’s (2024) recommendations for the Bank to build on its previous forecast evaluation efforts, and to do more to identify and explain its forecast errors. Drawing on some of the Report’s findings, this box summarises how the economy has evolved relative to the Bank’s forecasts and some takeaways for the MPC. How has the economy evolved relative to the Bank’s forecasts in recent years? The current economic outlook is, in part, shaped by the series of significant economic shocks the UK has faced in recent years. These have made forecasting over this period particularly challenging. The UK economy has faced a sequence of historically large shocks over the past few years ( Bailey (2023) , Pill (2024) , Mann (2025) , Taylor (2025) ). That sequence of shocks alongside a number of structural changes continues to be felt in current economic conditions. They have also made forecasting over this period particularly challenging, and, as noted by Bernanke (2024) , have meant that central banks across the world, including the Bank, have made larger forecast errors than in previous years. Consistent with that, the FER shows that the accuracy of the Bank’s forecasts, as measured by root mean squared errors, has deteriorated compared to the pre-pandemic period. Charts F.1 and F.2 show realised data outturns compared with successive Bank forecasts since August 2021. These suggest, on average, that outturns have been higher than forecast for CPI inflation, GDP growth and wage growth, and below forecasts for the unemployment rate. Chart F.1: CPI inflation and GDP growth outturns have tended to exceed forecasts Forecasts and outturns for CPI inflation and GDP growth ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Latest data points shown are for 2025 Q3, except for CPI inflation for which latest data points shown are for 2025 Q4. Lines in light purple show the successive Bank forecasts for each variable, including those published alongside the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report up to the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report. Lines in orange show forecasts as at the time of the August 2024 Monetary Policy Report, which is one year prior to the latest available data point. Forecasts shown are for four-quarter growth in GDP and CPI inflation (seasonally adjusted). Chart F.2: Wage growth has tended to be stronger than expected over the past five years, while unemployment has been higher than projected a year ago Forecasts and outturns for wage growth and unemployment ( a ) Footnotes Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Refer to Chart F.1. Forecasts shown are for four-quarter growth in whole-economy total average weekly earnings and for the level of the unemployment rate. Data outturns for CPI inflation, GDP growth, wage growth and the unemployment rate have been higher than forecast in the August 2024 projections. These charts also highlight how data outturns have evolved relative to the projections published in the August 2024 Monetary Policy Report (Charts F.1 and F.2, orange lines). These suggest that errors have generally been smaller over this more recent period than on average over the past five years. CPI inflation has been higher than projected in August 2024. That difference partly reflects particularly strong food price inflation and changes announced in Autumn Budget 2024, such as increases in a number of administered prices and employer NICs. It also partly reflects stronger-than-expected wage growth. Wage growth has fallen back over the past year, but by less than had been expected in the August 2024 Report. The Bank’s models partly attribute this news to inflation expectations, which have been stronger than their historical relationships with other variables would suggest, and the increase in employer NICs. As outlined in previous Monetary Policy Reports, however, those models have struggled to explain some of the recent strength in wage growth, suggesting some role for more persistent inflationary pressures or structural factors (Box F of the November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). The analysis on heterogeneity in wage-setting presented in Box B does not find evidence for the role of structural factors, however. GDP growth has exceeded projections from August 2024, with the difference partly reflecting looser than previously announced fiscal policy alongside an easing in financial conditions. The unemployment rate has also been higher than the August 2024 expectation. This contrasts with the past five years, when outturns have tended to be lower than projected on average. The larger-than-expected rise in unemployment may reflect an increase in structural unemployment, owing in part to increases in labour costs (Section 3.2), or could reflect a cyclical reversal in the excess hiring observed after the pandemic. Over the past five years, inflation has been stronger than expected on average, with the peak upside inflation forecast error occurring in late 2022… Building on this overview of the performance of the most recent forecasts, the FER explores some of the drivers of the Bank’s forecast errors over the past five years in greater detail. Forecast errors have generally been larger over this period. On average, since mid-2021, inflation outturns have tended to come in stronger than the Bank’s forecasts (Chart F.1, left panel). The peak one year ahead inflation forecast error was in October 2022 when CPI inflation reached 11.1%, 8 percentage points above the forecast produced in August 2021. Bank staff estimates suggest that half of that peak forecast error reflected the rise in energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Higher-than-expected global export prices can explain much of the remainder. …persistence in domestic wage and price setting, which was not well captured by the Bank’s standard models, explains some of the forecast errors after that peak. The Bank’s medium-term inflation forecasts were also repeatedly too low, on average, after the inflation peak in 2022. The initial shocks, which led to the sharp rises in inflation, also resulted in more persistent domestic price and wage increases, or second-round effects. Consistent with that, stronger-than-expected inflation outturns were accompanied by stronger-than-expected wage outturns. As discussed previously, it is also possible that the persistent strength in wage and price growth may have reflected structural changes in wage-setting behaviour. The MPC applied judgements in real time to help account for these persistence effects, which were not well captured by the Bank’s standard models. These persistence judgements reduced the size of the inflation forecast errors over this period. As estimating the size and speed of those effects is challenging, those judgements have been informed by a range of other model estimates and analysis and updated over time to reflect new information. The latest version of the MPC’s persistence judgements suggests second-round effects will push up on annual inflation until end-2027 (Chart 3.2 in Section 3.1). There remain risks and uncertainty around the strengths of these mechanisms and how quickly they might fade. Exploring the risks that greater inflation persistence might present to the MPC’s central projections has informed a number of recent scenarios ( May 2025 Monetary Policy Report and November 2025 Monetary Policy Report ). GDP growth has been stronger than forecasts on average since mid-2021. GDP growth has, on average, exceeded forecasts since mid-2021 (Chart F.1, right panel). During this period, growth was initially weaker than the Bank’s projections due to the unanticipated surge in energy prices and higher interest rates in response to rising inflation. Growth later outperformed expectations as energy prices fell faster than anticipated, the hit to activity proved smaller, and fiscal support helped limit the impact on household incomes. In more recent years, positive GDP surprises have also coincided with less economic slack, which also reflects estimates of potential supply growth having been judged to be slightly weaker than expected. A series of significant shocks have weighed on potential supply, such as the after-effects of the pandemic, the energy price shock and the change in trading relationships with the EU ( Bailey (2023) ). Longer-term statistical analysis identified the Bank’s labour market forecasts as an area for improvement. The FER also includes some longer-term statistical analysis, which evaluates forecast performance over the past 10 years. This analysis pointed to the Bank’s labour market forecasts as an area for improvement. The Report’s findings suggest that forecast errors for wage growth have been skewed in opposite directions either side of the pandemic. And the unemployment rate has been overpredicted on average since 2015, even though it has been underpredicted in the most recent forecasts. There is also evidence that both the wage and unemployment forecasts could have made better use of information that was available at the times the forecasts were made. What do the FER findings mean for the MPC? The FER finds the Bank’s forecasts are at least as accurate as alternative forecasts, although there is still more to do to advance the Bank’s understanding of the mechanisms driving some forecast errors, particularly on the labour market. The FER finds the Bank’s forecasts have been at least as accurate as the average of external forecasters and a range of model-based alternatives over the past decade, consistent with findings from the Bernanke Review (2024) . While the accuracy of the Bank’s forecasts has reduced since 2020, that is also true of the range of comparable benchmarks. As noted above, the FER points to the labour market and wage‑price dynamics as key areas for model improvement, with the post‑2022 persistence of inflation and robust wage growth underscoring the importance of better capturing links between labour‑market tightness, wage growth, CPI inflation and inflation expectations. Expanding on work in these areas would represent a further step towards the ‘continuous learning’ about the structure of the economy that the Bernanke Review recommends ( Lombardelli (2024) ). These findings further highlight the importance of the MPC drawing on a range of inputs, alongside the central projections, to inform members’ judgements and understanding of the economic outlook. The MPC often draws on alternative models, diverse data sources or analysis to inform the judgements layered on the forecasts (for example, the MPC persistence judgements and MPC judgements to boost demand over 2023 (Key judgement 2 in the February 2023 Monetary Policy Report )), or in some cases to help Committee members outline where their views on the economic outlook differ from the central projections (as set out for example in the MPC members’ views section of the February 2026 Monetary Policy Summary and Minutes ). The FER findings further highlight the importance of the MPC continuing to draw on sources that offer alternative views on economic mechanisms, particularly those that the Bank’s standard forecasts tend to capture less well.

Annex 2: Model-based policy simulations Annex 2: Model-based policy simulations At its meeting ending on 17 December 2025, the Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.75%. Four members voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4%. CPI inflation had fallen since the previous meeting, to 3.2%. Although above the 2% target, it was now expected to fall back towards target more quickly in the near term. Reflecting restrictive monetary policy, and consistent with evidence of subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market, pay growth and services price inflation had continued to ease. Monetary policy was being set to ensure CPI inflation settled sustainably at 2% in the medium term, which involved balancing the risks around achieving this. The risk from greater inflation persistence had become somewhat less pronounced since the November meeting, while the risk to medium-term inflation from weaker demand remained. The extent of further easing in monetary policy would depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. The restrictiveness of policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been reduced by 150 basis points since August 2024. On the basis of the evidence, Bank Rate was likely to continue on a gradual downward path. But judgements around further policy easing would become a closer call.

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 25 read with Section 23 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. A statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the bank’s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The bank had failed to submit credit information of its customers to any of the Credit Information Companies (CICs). This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers.

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 58G(1)(b) read with Section 58B(5)(aa) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The correspondence between RBI and the company revealed, inter alia, non-compliance with RBI directions. Based on the same, a notice was issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the company’s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The company had failed to obtain prior written permission of RBI for change in shareholding in excess of 26 per cent of its paid-up equity capital. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the company with its customers.

My colleagues and I are pleased to be here today to answer your questions. These hearings are an important part of the accountability process for the Reserve Bank. As you know, our mission is to promote the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people, now and into the future. We do this by conducting monetary policy with the aim of maintaining low and stable inflation and full employment, and we also support the stability of the financial system. But our responsibilities go beyond this – we work to support a reliable, efficient and competitive payments system, deliver efficient and effective banking services to Australian government agencies and provide secure and reliable banknotes. Since we last met with the Committee, the Monetary Policy Board judged that it was appropriate to tighten monetary policy to help to return inflation to target. I will start with some background to this decision and the outlook for the Australian economy. I’ll then make some remarks on the payments system and cash distribution. And I’ll finish off with an update on our progress towards achieving the objectives of the RBA Review. Inflation and employment As I noted, the Monetary Policy Board conducts monetary policy with the aim of maintaining low and stable inflation and full employment. The Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy sets out our agreement with the Government that an appropriate goal is consumer price inflation between 2 and 3 per cent. To achieve this, we set policy such that inflation is expected to return to the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent target range. But there is flexibility around the timeframe in which we meet our inflation objective to balance this with meeting our full employment objective – achieving the maximum level of employment that is consistent with low and stable inflation in the medium term. On the first part of our mandate, inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022. However, after a period of being within the 2–3 per cent target range, inflation picked up over the second half of 2025 to be materially higher than earlier anticipated. Underlying (trimmed mean) inflation – which removes the more volatile movements in any given quarter – had been easing and reached 2.7 per cent in mid-2025, before increasing to 3.4 per cent over the year to the December quarter 2025. The pick-up in inflation over the second half of 2025 was observed across a broad range of categories, including for services, retail goods and the cost of building new homes. Headline inflation – which has been affected by temporary cost-of-living relief measures – increased to be 3.6 per cent over the year to the December quarter. On the second part of our mandate, various indicators continue to suggest that labour market conditions remain close to, if a little tighter than, full employment. After a period of easing, labour market conditions have stabilised in recent months, in line with the pick-up in the growth of demand. The unemployment rate, which averaged 4.2 per cent in the December quarter, is low by historical standards – and the share of the population with a job is close to a record high. There are 1.7 million more Australians in employment since the start of the pandemic. This is a welcome development for those individuals, their families and the wider Australian economy. Recent monetary policy decisions and the economic outlook Earlier this week the Monetary Policy Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent. As I mentioned earlier, while inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it picked up materially in the second half of 2025. As recently as August 2025, we were forecasting inflation to be sustainably back within the 2–3 per cent band by this year. Private demand had picked up but was not growing particularly strongly. Labour market conditions were easing gradually. And the world economy looked very uncertain, with global growth forecasts revised downwards. But over the second half of 2025, this picture progressively turned around, with a range of data increasingly suggesting that international conditions, domestic demand and inflation were turning out stronger than we expected. The Monetary Policy Board highlighted this evolving assessment in the statements accompanying its November and December meetings. Much of the recent increase in inflation is judged to be temporary – but some of it seems to be persistent. Indeed, our outlook now sees inflation not coming back into the target band until the middle of next year. What has driven this change in outlook? There are a few factors. First, financial conditions have eased. We previously judged monetary policy to have remained a bit restrictive through 2025 – but the recent inflation data and the pick-up in credit growth cast some question over this. Second, the world economy has proved much more resilient than expected so that growth in our major trading partners has been much stronger than forecast. This partly reflects the resilience of the global trading system, which has adjusted faster than expected to tariff changes. But it’s also a consequence of the ongoing boom in AI investment, which has spilled over to a number of high-income Asian economies that supply chips and other key inputs. Third, private demand looks to have increased more strongly over the latter part of last year than we were expecting. Household consumption and business investment both drove this strength. Consistent with that strengthening of demand, the labour market has been a bit stronger than expected since November, and we judge that it remains a bit tight. We hear from surveys and our own liaison that some firms are still finding it difficult to find staff with the right skills and experience. This is another symptom of excess demand for goods and services in the economy. Given the inflation outcomes, the Board judged that stronger-than-expected demand in aggregate was pushing up against the ability of the economy to supply all of the goods and services being demanded. In other words, there was more excess demand in the economy than earlier judged. This means that we need to dampen the growth of demand, unless the supply side of the economy can expand a little quicker. This is where productivity comes in. Faster productivity growth allows for stronger growth in incomes and spending without the emergence of inflationary pressures. Based on its assessment that the economy is more capacity constrained, the Board judged that monetary policy needed to be tighter, to dampen aggregate demand growth and to help to return the economy to balance over the forecast period. It therefore judged that it was appropriate to raise the cash rate. There are of course risks to this outlook – forecasts are always uncertain. One that the Board will be monitoring closely is the extent to which the stronger inflation we have observed is persistent or temporary – that is, the extent to which the economy is capacity constrained. The Board will be closely monitoring the incoming data and continually assessing the extent of capacity constraints. If growth in demand is stronger than expected, and growth in the economy’s supply capacity remains limited, it is likely to add further to capacity pressures, and hence inflation persistence. If demand growth is weaker, or supply growth is stronger, inflation may return towards target more quickly. Significant uncertainties also remain in the global economy, with elevated trade and geopolitical risks: circumstances could change quickly. I recognise the challenges that the cash rate increase brings for Australians with mortgages. But it is the right thing for the economy as a whole. We need to ensure that inflation is low and stable so that households and businesses can plan, invest and create jobs. High inflation hurts all Australians – whether you’re paying a mortgage, renting, running a business, or just trying to make ends meet. It is especially tough on people with lower incomes and those in more vulnerable situations. Payments system Another key responsibility for the RBA is our regulation and oversight of the payments system. The RBA is committed to promoting and supporting a modern and innovative payment system in Australia. We are completing our review of surcharging and merchant card payment costs. This review has benefited from extensive engagement from a broad range of stakeholders, including over 170 written submissions to our consultation paper. The staff have also conducted over 100 bilateral meetings and gathered additional evidence from stakeholders. The Payments System Board will publish its conclusions by the end of March 2026. After the review of merchant card payment costs and surcharging, we will consult on which issues should be prioritised by the RBA under the amended Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 . These amendments expanded the RBA’s remit to a broader range of payment systems and their participants – including three-party card schemes, mobile wallets, ‘buy-now, pay-later’ providers and e-commerce platforms. This consultation is expected to take place in mid-2026. We acknowledge that on 8 December 2025 this Committee commenced its Inquiry into Schemes, Digital Wallets and Innovation in the Payments Sector . The RBA has made a submission to the inquiry and looks forward to your deliberations. We see the Committee’s work as complementary and concurrent to the RBA’s own consultations in the payments area. The RBA has also contributed to the Council of Financial Regulators ‘Better Regulation Roadmap’, which is promoting streamlined regulation to help drive stronger productivity growth in our economy. As part of this, the RBA is supporting innovation by exploring how new forms of digital money can support tokenised asset markets and creating a plan for modernising Australia’s core settlement infrastructure – the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS). I also wanted to note that on 27 January, the RBA experienced a system issue that disrupted some payment and property settlement services. We restored settlement for these services in the afternoon, but a second issue for property settlements meant that full restoration was not achieved until the evening. We apologise for the disruption caused by the incident. We recognise the critical role we play in the payments system and are conducting a full review of the incident, which we plan to publish before the end of February. This incident reinforces the importance of the RBA’s active program of work to strengthen the operational stability of its critical settlement systems. Cash distribution I would also like to update the Committee on recent developments in the cash distribution system. Cash remains a critical part of an inclusive and resilient payments system. Although the use of cash for everyday payments has declined in recent decades, a range of indicators suggest cash use has stabilised in the past few years. The RBA remains committed to supporting the Australian Government’s policy objective to ensure cash remains a viable means of payment for as long as Australians want or need to use it. The cash distribution system has faced significant challenges. These issues are most pressing for rural and regional areas. The industry needs to work together towards a more sustainable distribution system that supports the needs of all Australians. Linfox Armaguard – which is the main provider of cash-in-transit services – and its major banking and retail customers have been working towards a future pricing model. This is aimed at supporting more sustainable and efficient distribution arrangements. Any proposed model would need to be considered by the ACCC. As the issuer of Australian banknotes, the RBA also plays a key role in cash distribution. We provide banknotes to the major banks, who distribute these to the broader community. We are continuing to work with industry so that the RBA’s arrangements and incentives support efficient distribution and encourage banks to hold cash across the country. We also continue to work closely with other public agencies to support the long-term availability of cash in the public interest. The Council of Financial Regulators (CFR), which I chair, together with the ACCC, is taking an active interest in cash distribution. Last year, the CFR and ACCC jointly consulted on potential regulatory guardrails to support resilience and fair access to critical cash distribution services. The Government also recently introduced a mandate for large grocery stores and petrol stations to accept cash, which aims to support Australians who want to pay in cash for essential goods. Progress towards achieving the objectives from the Review of the RBA to be fit for the future As you know, the RBA Review was released in April 2023. The Review recognised the RBA’s longstanding contribution to Australia’s economic success and the professionalism of our staff, while identifying areas for improvement. It focused on a few key areas – monetary policy, governance, transparency and culture – that are central to our effectiveness as Australia’s central bank. The findings from the Review have shaped our transformation agenda since that time. Some recommendations from the Review involved actions that we could undertake ourselves – changes to the number and timing of Board meetings, our Board processes, and our culture and leadership capabilities. But other recommendations required legislative change, including the creation of a separate Governance Board. So, in March 2025, the most significant reforms to the RBA since the 1990s came into effect. Our work is now overseen by three boards: the Governance Board, the Monetary Policy Board and the Payments System Board. The Governance Board is now the accountable authority under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is effectively responsible for overseeing the operations of the RBA including strategy, risk, resourcing, budget and the balance sheet. But there is one important difference with boards in commercial organisations – we are a policy institution and so there are circumstances where policy takes precedence over normal commercial considerations. A good example is use of the balance sheet for monetary policy or financial stability considerations. Nevertheless, the creation of the Governance Board has sharpened our focus, strengthened decision-making and improved accountability, supporting our commitment to modernising the RBA. In line with its new responsibilities, the Governance Board published a report on our progress in meeting the recommendations of the Review in December last year. To date, the RBA and the Government have addressed 41 of the 51 recommendations. Clear implementation plans are in place for the remaining recommendations, and the necessary work is well under way. We will implement two further recommendations in 2026: publication of a framework for additional monetary policy tools and convening of an external expert advisory group on monetary policy. The remaining recommendations are ongoing commitments, where we have established the structures, processes and capabilities needed to sustain progress in these areas. They include initiatives to strengthen leadership, embed cultural change, enhance analytical expertise and deepen our understanding of monetary and fiscal policy interactions. We have also committed to conducting future reviews of the monetary policy framework and our institutional capability. Our work does not end with the implementation of specific recommendations. In the spirit of the Review, we are embracing a mindset of continuous improvement – recognising that the environment in which we operate is dynamic and that our institutional practices must continue to evolve. We remain committed to pursuing excellence in everything we do as we build an RBA that is fit for the future. I will finish on that note.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank The Economist for the invitation to address The World Ahead 2026 here in Athens. In a year that will test economic and geopolitical resilience, I would like to briefly assess the current state of the Greek and European banking sectors and then turn to the main risks and challenges that lie ahead. Over the past decade, the Greek banking sector has undergone a profound transformation, with balance sheets, profitability, liquidity and capital positions improving substantially, in line with Greece's macroeconomic recovery, positive fiscal developments, and the normalisation of financial conditions. In fact, one of the important lessons from Greece's experience is the strong interaction between the recovery of the economy, its improving fiscal situation and the positive course of the banking sector through a virtuous feedback loop. Greek banks have effectively completed the clean-up of their balance sheets. Since March 2016 – when non-performing loans peaked – the total reduction in the stock of legacy loans has reached 95%. A key driver of this reduction has been the set-up of the Hellenic Asset Protection Scheme (HAPS), which facilitated large-scale NPL securitisations through state guarantees on senior notes. As a result, by Q3 2025 the system-wide NPL ratio had declined to 3.6%. Domestic liquidity conditions remain ample, reflecting strong deposit growth and stable market access. Deposits continue to increase, while all banks enjoy undisrupted access to wholesale funding markets, supporting their capacity to finance the real economy. Bank profitability remains solid and broad-based, supported by credit expansion and high operating efficiency. Credit growth has been concentrated mainly in lending to non-financial corporations, including projects related to the RRF. Moreover, the low cost of credit risk and high cost efficiency have also supported profitability. Overall, system-wide Return on Equity has strengthened, reaching double-digit levels of around 12%. Banks have also taken steps to diversify their income sources and expand their business activity beyond traditional domestic credit. Recent examples include Eurobank's and Alpha Bank's acquisitions of Hellenic Bank and AstroBank, respectively, in Cyprus, as well as the acquisitions of Ethniki Insurance and Eurolife by Piraeus Bank and Eurobank, respectively. Moreover, Alpha Bank has established a strategic partnership with UniCredit in Romania, while UniCredit has also acquired a stake of around 30% in Alpha Bank. In addition, CrediaBank has reached an agreement to acquire HSBC's subsidiary in Malta. These transactions reflect a more outward-looking business model and greater regional integration. Improved profitability and capital-accretive actions have strengthened banks' capital positions. Capital adequacy currently stands at around 20%, well above regulatory requirements, enhancing loss-absorption capacity. These improvements are also reflected in supervisory assessments and market confidence. No Greek significant institution is currently classified in the lowest and most risky category, marking a clear shift from crisis management to more business-as-usual supervision. This progress enabled dividend distributions in 2024, the first in 15 years. Finally, the clean-up of less significant institutions has strengthened competition within the Greek banking sector. The recapitalisation of CrediaBank, following the absorption of Pancreta, together with NPL disposals under the Hellenic Asset Protection Scheme, has effectively created a ""fifth pole"" of smaller but sound banks alongside the significant institutions. Overall, the Greek banking sector is now in a much stronger position to support economic growth and absorb potential shocks. Enhanced resilience (confirmed by the results of the recent EU-wide stress testing exercise), improved market access and the restoration of investment-grade conditions, provide a solid foundation going into 2026, which is particularly important in an environment characterised by high uncertainty. The improvement observed in Greece mirrors a broader strengthening of the European banking sector. European banks have gradually rebuilt resilience since the Global Financial Crisis. Based on the latest available data: 1 Capital buffers across the EU banking sector have increased substantially over time. While the total Capital Ratio stood at just 13% in December 2009, it reached 20.4% by September 2025, supported by strong profitability and capital-enhancing measures. Asset quality has improved markedly, representing one of the most significant achievements of the past decade. The average NPL ratio declined from nearly 7% in 2016 to just 1.8% in September 2025. Profitability has also recovered, after a prolonged period of weak returns. After years of marginal returns, EU banks recorded an average Return on Equity of 10.7% by September 2025, supporting internal capital generation. Despite stronger fundamentals for European and Greek banks, the outlook for 2026 remains subject to significant downside risks. These risks stem mainly from external and structural factors. Geopolitical risk continues to be the dominant source of uncertainty for banks. Ongoing conflicts, trade tensions and tariffs may affect banks through weaker growth prospects and heightened market volatility. Cyber risk has emerged as a key operational and financial stability concern. The rising frequency of cyber incidents underlines the challenging environment and highlights the need for rapid remediation. Full compliance with DORA requirements, that is the EU Regulation for digital operational resilience for the financial sector, and the timely closure of any remaining gaps, are essential, while investment in digitalisation will enable banks to keep pace with technological developments and alleviate competitive pressure, especially by neobanks. Although asset quality remains strong, pockets of vulnerability require close monitoring. Certain segments of corporate and retail lending may face pressure, underscoring the need for prudent lending standards and the importance of proactive risk management. Structural challenges related to demographics and climate change pose longer-term risks. Population ageing, social cohesion pressures, climate and environmental risks could have material macroeconomic and financial implications. Regarding the latter, while banks in the euro area have made significant progress in managing climate-related risks, extreme weather events and rising global temperatures could still lead to sizeable economic and financial losses, particularly where insurance coverage remains limited. Contagion risks may arise from non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI's) and crypto-asset markets. These sectors can amplify shocks through liquidity and confidence channels, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive supervisory micro- and macroprudential approach. The role of NBFIs in the provision of financial services has grown significantly without a commensurate enhancement of the regulatory and supervisory framework. This renders NBFIs a potential source of systemic risk, particularly in the current environment of heightened geopolitical risks and elevated financial asset valuations. Specifically, the interlinkages between banks and NBFIs – spanning funding, credit and market activities – can amplify shocks and transmit stress across the global financial sector. For instance, these linkages can create vulnerabilities through loss of short-term NBFI funding and credit exposures to leveraged NBFIs, exposing banks to market shocks and liquidity pressures. In addition, vulnerabilities within NBFIs, especially from investment funds with high leverage and limited liquidity, could amplify adverse market dynamics through forced asset sales, reduced liquidity, and procyclical selling behavior. Contagion risks could also arise from the growing interlinkages between crypto-asset markets and the traditional financial system. Beyond financial stability concerns from this interconnectedness, a significant rapid expansion of stablecoins in the EU, especially those pegged to the USD, may interfere with the smooth transmission of monetary policy, the intermediation role of banks and the orderly market functioning, ultimately undermining monetary sovereignty. Furthermore, money laundering risks are ever present in the crypto sector and continue to pose significant challenges for effective supervision, especially when considering the relevant fragmented regulatory landscape at the global level. As supervisors, we are making conscious efforts to simplify our regulatory and supervisory framework while ensuring that resilience and the effectiveness in meeting prudential objectives is maintained. European harmonization and financial integration is fostered, and international cooperation (notably the compliance with Basel principles) is upheld. To this end, both the ECB and the SSM published late last year two reports that set the scene for a simpler regulatory and supervisory framework in the euro area. In conclusion, despite the progress achieved and the sound fundamentals of European and Greek banks, there is no room for complacency. With risks to financial stability remaining elevated, supervisors should ensure that financial institutions act prudently, preserve strong capital and liquidity buffers, and maintain high governance standards. At the same time, further institutional deepening at the European level remains essential: completing the Banking Union – particularly through the finalisation of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme with a clear and credible timetable – would reduce financial fragmentation and strengthen confidence, while advancing the Savings and Investment Union is key to mobilising private savings and fostering deeper and more efficient capital markets. Ultimately, strengthening financial and operational resilience is critical in an environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty. 1 https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard .

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good afternoon, everyone. Before we dive into the issue of digital dependence in Europe, let me start with a confession: I spent part of last weekend practicing my English pronunciation: fault lines versus vault lines. The first one with an 'F', the second one with a 'V'. Well-known examples of the first one are the San Andreas fault line in California, or the North Anatolian fault line in Turkey. And the thing about these fault lines, these often-unseen cracks, is that we know they are there, we know they can shake foundations and shatter lives, but we don't know when these powerful forces will strike. On the other hand, you have vault lines – with a V. When I'm talking about vaults, today, I'm not talking about the place we keep our gold, but about vaults as in arches of resilience. Whenever you visit the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, or the chapel of King's College in Cambridge, or any great chapel or church in Europe, and look up to the ceiling, you'll probably see them: those stone arches that carry the weight and absorb the strain. Those visible lines of strength, deliberately built, stone on stone, to withstand pressure. Those are the vault lines I'm talking about. They keep things together – prevent the roof from falling on our heads. And provide shelter and safety. Now, the reason I practiced these two words, similar in sound, but very different in meaning, is that the one – with an F – describes our current world, and the second – with a V – our future world, ideally, at least. How so? Well, let me start with our current world. Our financial system also has fault lines – cracks. And those cracks have a capacity, similar to any tectonic fault line, to cause crises. Today, I want to talk about one of those fault lines: Europe's digital dependence. Together with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets – the AFM – we wrote a report on this topic. We did this because, currently, many European financial institutions are entrusting more and more of their IT stack to a limited number of IT service providers. Cloud services are dominated by a few IT companies, the so-called hyperscalers. And, as you well know, many IT applications are built on these services. Often also for specialized services, for instance in cyber security, many financial institutions turn to a few smaller service providers. For sure, relying on one IT provider for cloud services has efficiency benefits and gives access to innovative service, but it also makes institutions vulnerable. Because if that one hyperscaler were to fail - or become the victim of a cyber-attack - the effects would be immediate. And if it were ordered by its government to halt services for certain customers, stability could be severely jeopardised. This concentration risk exposes a fault line in the financial sector. Because what seems stable today, might suddenly start to quiver and quake. And it is not just about concentration risk. Because reliance on the same few large IT providers has also created systemic risks. Meaning that in a system as interconnected as our financial system, the lights going off at one hyperscaler, could very possibly affect the entire financial system. It is undeniable that the fault lines under our European financial system have become far more prone to cracking in recent years. Right on Europe's borders, a ruthless aggressor is waging hybrid warfare. At the same time, some of our longstanding global relationships have soured. Values once thought common, like privacy and the rule of law, are no longer self-evident. And when once-partners diverge on fundamental values, fissures appear, following decades of trust. And this puts our financial system at risk. Looking beyond these immediate threats, the DNB/AFM report sketches four directions that can shape Europe's digital footing: One – in a world with increasing geopolitical pressures, and a digital stand-still in Europe, we become a digital colony dominated by external forces. Two – in a world with increasing geopolitical pressures, but with a Europe that finds its own digital strength, we live in a fragmented world of separate technology spheres. Three – in a world with DE-creasing geopolitical tensions, but still with a digital stand-still in Europa, we remain digitally dependent on non-European IT providers. And four – in a world with DE-creasing geopolitical tensions AND with a Europe that finds its own digital strength, we succeed in creating a human-centred path of digitalisation, meaning that European IT capabilities grow, our digital dependence declines, and all of this happens in sync with European values such as privacy, and the rule of law. Obviously, now that we are aware of the risks of the fault line that our digital dependence represents, the fourth scenario is the one to prefer. But since this is also the hardest one of the four to achieve, action is urgent. So, where to start? Indeed, as I said at the outset, looking ahead requires a shift in perspective. From what breaks to what endures. From what threatens to what protects. From the fault lines with an F to the vault lines with a V. That is what we need in our financial system: strong structures and stable partnerships, built on shared values, to protect our system from shocks caused by the cracks beneath the surface. In the near term, these vault lines – with a V – will consist of preparing ourselves the best we can – given our state of dependence. Today, independence is not on the table, because it is simply not available. It is not yet attainable. No European alternative is adequate to take the place of one of the big non-European IT providers. And so, preparation is key – for instance by developing and rehearsing actual threat scenarios. In doing so, two fast-moving situations should receive special emphasis: hybrid attacks – meaning a combination of physical and digital attacks – that disrupt shared infrastructure, and sanctions that force key third-party suppliers to suspend services. Financial institutions are already working together closely on this by sharing vital information. In our report, we urge them to also test whole chains of systems with their main suppliers, and as such learn how disruptions might spread. This helps to spot weak points early and to contain problems before they can shake the entire system. The AFM and DNB stand ready to facilitate this work wherever we can be of assistance. A good practice we found at a few financial institutions, is investing in more flexibility – wherever possible. As such, they redesign applications to improve portability, adopt open standards and use container technologies to reduce dependency. Procurement practices are also shifting in this direction. We see that financial institutions are broadening their vendor base and exploring multi-vendor strategies. These steps do not eliminate dependency risks, but they do provide institutions with more options when conditions change. One essential vault line – with a V – which the European financial sector needs to construct or strengthen, is control over its data. In this regard, it is promising that financial institutions are looking more and more often at European IT providers. They are also reassessing the European variants offered by global hyperscalers – the so-called EU sovereign cloud offerings. In that last scenario, the central question remains, of course, whether any of these arrangements truly strengthens control and resilience when circumstances become difficult, and a foreign government starts threatening. In our report, we suggest that financial institutions increasingly retain their own encryption keys. This would ensure, in the near term, that the protection of critical information remains firmly under their stewardship. All in all, financial institutions must assess all available options carefully and plan for continuity. Of course, switching providers is never simple – it is costly and time-consuming, even if we expect or eventually even compel providers to facilitate this when asked to. But preparation matters. It shows institutions what can realistically be done when disruption strikes and where additional work is still needed. In this way, they strengthen the vault lines that help the system hold firm when the ground begins to shake. Now, turning to the longer term, the goal is pretty straightforward: we need to reduce our reliance on non-European providers. And we need to do this by reinforcing Europe's digital capabilities and addressing the causes of our current dependency. This long-term goal is a joint project of the European tech industry, the financial sector and public authorities. And yes, policy is already moving in the right direction. We already see protective vault lines emerging in legislation like DORA – the European Digital Operational Resilience Act, which entered into force in January 2025. But truth be told, even with DORA in place, vulnerabilities persist – especially those that are linked to geopolitical developments and to the location of critical data. DORA provides a good start, but we must continue to focus on key vulnerabilities, like concentration risks, who has jurisdiction over critical data and applications, and how far supervisory powers extend. In order to develop European IT capabilities, we must get to work. Earlier, I described four possible scenarios for our digital future. To realise the preferred fourth scenario, the one in which Europe leads the way in promoting human-centred digitalisation, will demand time, determination and sustained investment in European IT. As such, where possible, financial institutions should work more closely with European IT providers for critical services. By aligning specifications, running coordinated tests, and offering purchase guarantees, they can help create the scale needed for viable and competitive European cloud providers to emerge. But scale alone is not enough. To truly strengthen Europe's digital footing, we also need joined testing. For instance, when it comes to the security of the entire chain of operations, from primary IT providers to every subcontractor involved. Joint testing helps us spot vulnerabilities early, before they can spread through the system. And even that is only part of the answer. To genuinely build Europe's digital strength, we must also invest in the companies capable of delivering it. That means strengthening the savings and investment union, so that more European capital flows to innovative European firms - the firms that can build the digital services we will rely on tomorrow. And yes, where necessary we must also improve regulation - making oversight more enforceable, clarifying expectations on geopolitical risk and data location, and, in due course, considering a cross-sector European cloud supervisor. By continuing to work together – financial institutions, policy makers, and the European tech industry – we can gradually reduce our digital dependencies and strengthen the resilience of our financial sector. Step by step, we can shift from merely spotting the fault lines that may fracture beneath us to actively reinforcing the vault lines that keep Europe's financial system safe and secure. And if you still can't hear the difference between fault with and F and vault with a V, don't worry. Just remember: the first one cracks, the second one endures. Thank you.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Dear representatives of the EBRD, Dear friends, colleagues and media representatives, It is a pleasure to welcome you to the presentation of this year's EBRD Transition Report, which focuses on one of the most powerful yet often underestimated forces shaping our economies and societies: demographic change. Demography might seem like an abstract concept, but it is a fundamental force of development and prosperity. It evolves slowly, over cycles far longer than business or financial ones. This is precisely why it is not always at the centre of policy or central banking debates. However, we are currently living through a global demographic turning point and that begs our attention. As fewer people enter the labour force, more depend on pension and healthcare systems. These shifts are already putting pressure on productivity, public finances, political priorities, and long-term growth prospects across regions. At the Bank of Albania, we have been concerned about these issues and demographic developments for almost a decade. Population ageing and emigration are early identified as defining challenges for Albania's economic future. Our country mirrors many of the trends described in this report: rapid ageing combined with significant outflows of young and working-aged people. According to united nations projections, these dynamics are expected not only to persist, but to intensify in the years ahead, leading to a reversal of the demographic pyramid. Rapid demographic transformation is reshaping Albania's economy and society, which are now facing similar challenges with the one highlighted in the Transition Report. The population has been steadily declining while the average age is rising rapidly. The 2023 census records about 2.4 million inhabitants, roughly one third fewer than 1990. In the meantime, the average age has reached nearly 43 years. Emigration, once viewed as a mitigating factor for unemployment and poverty, is increasingly emerging as a structural challenge. Sustained economic growth, historically low unemployment, and labour shortages in key sectors have made the long-term consequences of demographic change more visible to both businesses and households. Population ageing affects both aggregate demand and supply: it alters consumption patterns, weakens innovation and productivity, raises production costs, and ultimately influences prices, investment, and productive capacity, thereby undermining the long-term sustainability of economic growth. Bank of Albania reports and analyses have repeatedly emphasized the adverse effects of these trends on the labour market, wages, inflation dynamics, and Albania's long run growth potential. The Albanian economy has however shown strong adaptability and resilience in recent years, supported by low inflation, sustained economic growth, rising employment and wages, an improving current account. Labor market conditions have improved markedly, with employment rising, unemployment falling to historically low levels, and labour productivity substantially higher than before the global financial crisis. Up to this moment, the market has adjusted and offset demographic pressures through the increase in participation rate which however this comes at the cost of higher wages and therefore more inflation pressures. The Bank of Albania has played a key role in these developments through a prudent, consistent, and proactive monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability and safeguarding purchasing power. Since mid-2024, the accommodative policy stance has helped anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty, and improve financial conditions, leading to lower borrowing costs and robust credit growth. In parallel, the banking sector has continued to strengthen, with improved indicators of liquidity, capitalization, and asset quality, while systemic risks remain contained. This solid financial position ensures that the banking system can continue to support economic activity through effective financial intermediation. Despite this success, negative demographic trends in Albania are expected to be persistent. Our studies show that they will likely put downward pressure on real interest rates. This environment limits the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy, as low interest rates leave central banks with less room to stimulate the economy. At the same time, demographic shifts may also complicate inflation dynamics. Our research shows that increase in labour market participation rate comes at the cost of higher wages. These national findings strongly resonate with the broader conclusions of the EBRD Transition Report. Across Emerging Europe, ageing populations and shrinking workforces are weighing on growth. However, policy response requires coordinated action and political will. These reforms require courage and honesty. They should deal with reforming pension systems, modernizing labour markets, designing realistic migration frameworks, and investing in healthy ageing. It also means embracing new technologies, including artificial intelligence, responsibly and inclusively. Above all, it requires ensuring that younger generations, whose voices risk being diluted, remain central to economic decision-making. Let me conclude with the central message of this year's Transition Report: demography does not have to be destiny. The report offers a rigorous and policy-relevant framework to understand demographic change and its economic implications. I hope it will serve not only as an analytical reference, but also as a catalyst for informed debate and decisive action. Thank you and I wish you a fruitful discussion of this Report!

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Happy New Year. It is always a great privilege to be invited to this gathering of [Rotary Club of] Makati West and Manila. What I will do is basically tell the same story that [Past Vice President] Joel [Valdes] has told, but I will assign some numbers to that story. I will talk about good news, and then I will talk about bad news. Although I would say the bad news is not that bad. The first piece of good news, I would say, is inflation. Inflation is down. We managed to tame inflation over the past two years. Not only is inflation down, it is even lower for the bottom 30 percent of households. So, we pay a lot of attention not just to the inflation rate in general, but also the inflation rate for the bottom 30 percent. So, blue [referring to a graph] is the inflation rate as measured. We call it headline inflation and then [the] red is the inflation rate that is based on the consumer basket of the bottom 30 percent. So, the blue one is 1.8 [percent] as of a few days ago for December and the red one is 1.1 percent. [They are] pretty low inflation rates, although we project that the inflation rates will start to rise over the next year or so. That is the first piece of good news. The second piece of good news I would say is-our banking system is in good shape. The way we measure the health of banking system, we look at capital adequacy and the international standard for capital adequacy in the way it is measured by central banks [which] says that it should be at least 10 percent. By capital adequacy, we mean when we measure whether it is adequate or not, we assign risk weights to various assets of the banks, and then there should be sufficient capital to support those risks. It is not just 10 percent for us, it is 16.4 percent, so that is pretty good. And then you also look at the liquidity of banks. In case there is a deposit run, the bank should have sufficient liquidity to support the run. The international standard for that is 100 percent. The way we measure the liquidity for our banks, it is [at] 180 percent. So, our banks are not just well capitalized, they are also very liquid. And then we also have international reserves. This is our protection against a balance of payments crisis. As of today, we hold US$110.9 billion of international reserves. That is more than seven months of imports. The usual standard is three months of imports. We are at seven months of imports. And then we are also at four times our short-term debt. The international standard for that is the same amount of short-term debt so, 100 percent of short-term debt. We are at 400 percent of short-term debt. So that is the good news. Let me go to the bad news. So, as you know, our growth has slowed down so we now think that for 2025, we will see 4.6-percent growth for the whole year. The difference between that and the growth we thought would be before the flood control scandal is given by that light brown portion [on the chart]. We thought growth would be 5.7 percent in 2025. Now it looks like more like 4.6 percent. That is mainly the effect of the loss of confidence, the weakness of sentiment because of the flood control scandal. [And] that loss of confidence started in the third quarter of 2025. We do think there will be some recovery in 2026. We think the growth rate will be [at] 5.6 percent. It is lower than what we thought it would be, but not much lower. By the way, these numbers are not too different when you look at the projections by the IMF (International Monetary Fund), by Bloomberg, and by the World Bank Although I think our projections are more accurate because we have a more sophisticated forecasting model. We take account of investor sentiment; we take account of many things that the IMF has not taken into account. And then we think there will be a strong recovery from that. So, I think we can manage 6.3 percent in 2027. If we can achieve that, that would be very good. By the way, all these other numbers, even those for 2025 and 2026, are better than those of our neighbors, in spite of the loss of sentiment. These numbers are better than Indonesia's, better than Malaysia's, better than Thailand's. The only country in the region that is doing better than us is Vietnam. So, that is where we stand. Let me show you one picture about sentiment. We look at many indicators of sentiment, and we stick those indicators into our models. They are tested by history. These things work historically. One thing we look at is what is called the PMI, the purchasing managers index. This is a good indicator. This is something that is also a good indicator for other countries. For the US, it is called the ISM (Institute for Supply Management) number. It is good because in the value chain, the guys who look into the future most seriously are the purchasing managers. They have to purchase [the] inventory of their production. They have to take account very seriously of the next year or so. And that number--by the way. there are two versions of it, but they both behave in the same way-that number started to fall in July and now about a month ago, it reached bottom. It has now started to go up. The other number is what you guys all look at: the stock exchange numbers, the foreign exchange rate, and so on. The stock exchange-the index-has fallen since the crisis, but now it has shown some recovery. So, the stock market is saying there is hope. So, those are the indicators that we look at. I think you all know that we reduced the policy rate in the last meeting. In December, we reduced the policy rate. That was an effort to compensate for the loss of confidence. We can only influence the demand side of things. We have no tools for the supply side. But on the demand side, if there is a loss of confidence, we can compensate for it a little bit by lowering the policy risk. But I think we were very close to the end of the easing cycle. There is only so much we can do. We cannot completely restore confidence. So, that is my story. I would welcome a few questions.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Check against delivery 1 Introductory remarks Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the first Bundesbank Spotlight in Berlin! What is the idea behind the new event format? We want to engage in personal dialogue with experts in their fields and with our guests. The focus of our first Spotlight will be the digital euro. For this event, we have invited two guests to the podium, and I am delighted that they are able to be here today: Ramona Pop from the Federation of German Consume Organisations, and Christian Sewing – who will engage in today's discussion not only in his capacity as CEO of Deutsche Bank but also as President of the Association of German Banks. By introducing the digital euro, we want to make our single currency, the euro, fit for the future. Our vision is to create a single European payment solution that is state of the art in terms of technology, enables innovation, makes Europe more independent and resilient, and is trustworthy. In the current project phase, we are preparing to be able to issue the digital euro in the course of 2029. We assume that the legal framework for the digital euro will be in place by the end of this year. This legal basis is a prerequisite for the Eurosystem to be able to start issuing the digital euro. We are working closely with policymakers and banks. They will be a crucial interface between users of the digital euro and the Eurosystem as its issuer. We are already in close dialogue with the general public and, through many events across the country, are clarifying what the digital euro is and what it is not – what benefits it will offer and how data protection and security will be ensured, for instance. According to a Forsa survey conducted on behalf of the Bundesbank, only 42 % of survey participants had heard or read about the digital euro in October 2025. And only just over one-quarter of them knew what it is: an additional digital means of payment issued by the Eurosystem. This shows that we have a considerable amount of work to do to educate the general public. 2 The benefits of the digital euro The digital euro will enable cashless payments to be made simply, securely and across borders throughout the euro area. The digital euro will be just as trustworthy as our banknotes and coins. It is intended to be a digital supplement, a digital ""twin"" to euro cash, and not a substitute. You would be able to use it just as easily as your girocard and existing payment apps on your smartphone – be it at a point of sale, in a restaurant, when shopping online or for credit transfers to friends. And it will also be able to be used offline. No other means of payment apart from the digital euro offers all these features at once in the euro area. The digital euro also presents an opportunity to overcome the strong fragmentation of the European payments market. At present, there is no European payment solution that is accepted in all euro area countries – except for cash. Instead, non-European providers, particularly from the United States, dominate the market. These providers often charge retailers high fees, which we as consumers ultimately pay, too. I'm sure you are familiar with the film ""Pretty Woman"". Then you might remember the quote ""Stores are never nice to people, they're nice to credit cards"". The truth, however, is that while retailers accept credit cards and online payment services, they often do so only reluctantly because of the high fees. By contrast, the digital euro will be a cost-effective alternative to existing digital means of payment for retailers. This is another reason why the retail sector is very open to the digital euro. After all, it will stimulate competition in the payment market. Critics, on the other hand, complain that this would cut the ground from under the feet of private sector initiatives for a European payment solution. But, the opposite is true: private sector solutions such as Wero could benefit from the pan-European reach of the digital euro, for example by integrating the digital euro into the Wero wallet. On the flip side, Wero could be an important means by which people use the digital euro – a win-win situation! I am also convinced that the market offers sufficient space for private and public sector providers. This is because consumers also appreciate the possibility of being able to choose between different options. The digital euro is also being designed to enable future innovations and functions. I am thinking, for instance, of conditional payments: a parcel only being paid for when the customer receives it, to name one example, or a travel refund being issued automatically if a train is delayed, to name another. Launching the digital euro also means we are increasing our strategic autonomy – something which is unfortunately desperately needed in view of geopolitical developments. Visa and Mastercard currently account for almost two-thirds of all card payments in the euro area. 13 out of 21 euro area countries do not have an own national card system like we have girocard in Germany. These countries therefore rely entirely on non-European card systems, including within their own country's borders. To put it bluntly, we are very dependent on US corporations in payments today – too dependent. Payments are part of our critical infrastructure. And we really ought to stand on our own two feet when it comes to critical infrastructure. The digital euro would be the first and only digital means of payment built on a European infrastructure that could be used seamlessly throughout the euro area. And what about data protection? To protect your data, we are designing the digital euro to offer the highest degree of privacy possible for an electronic means of payment. Privacy has been a top priority of the digital euro project since its inception. The Eurosystem central banks will not be able to tell who is behind individual payments. We certainly will not be able to and do not want to control what the public pay for with the digital euro. And those who use the digital euro offline will pay almost as anonymously as they do with cash. Many people are not even aware of how much data they share when paying using other digital means of payment. For some people it does not matter. However, we know from surveys that protecting privacy is a crucial factor for many consumers. According to the Forsa survey I mentioned earlier, it would represent the most important feature for 74 % of respondents. 3 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the digital euro will be a success. It is up to us to bring the euro to where a great future lies ahead of it: the digital world. The digital euro stands for payments that are simple, secure and European – open to innovation, regardless of external factors, and trustworthy for all. We want to develop the digital euro together with consumers, banks, retailers and policymakers. It is neither a project opposing cash, nor a project opposing private sector providers. It is a project of progress for our continent's population. The digital euro is an opportunity for Europe. Thank you for listening.

The views expressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Good morning, and thank you for the invitation to join you today. 1 It is a pleasure to be with you for the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking's 161st Assembly for Bank Directors. Before we get started on the fireside chat, since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, I think it would be helpful to summarize my views on the recent policy decision. I will then offer some remarks on the economy and also share my perspective on the outlook for monetary policy. As we enter 2026, the economy has continued to grow, and I see inflation moving closer to our goal. But beneath the surface, the labor market is fragile. I will provide some perspective on why I think that fragility poses the greater risk and what that means for the path of policy. Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting At our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Let me explain why I agreed to support this decision. I continue to see policy as moderately restrictive, and, looking ahead to 2026, my Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year. In my mind, the question at this meeting was about the timeline for implementing these cuts, essentially choosing between continuing to remove policy restraint and arriving at my estimate of neutral by the April meeting, or moving policy to neutral at a more measured pace throughout this year. I do not consider downside risks to the employment side of our mandate to have diminished, and I see several indications that the labor market remains vulnerable. I could have voted in favor of continuing to remove policy restraint in order to hedge more against the risk of further labor market deterioration. But we have seen some signs of stabilization, and, after lowering the policy rate by a total of 75 basis points in the latter part of last year, in my view, we can afford to take time and ""keep policy powder dry"" for a little while in order to carefully assess how the lower degree of policy restraint is flowing through to broader financial conditions and strengthening the labor market. I am also reluctant to take meaningful signal from the latest data releases given the statistical noise introduced by the government shutdown. And, given that by the time of our March meeting we will have received two additional inflation and employment reports, I saw merit in waiting to take action. It was not a straightforward decision. Ultimately, also considering that inflation remains somewhat elevated, at this meeting I decided to lean in favor of waiting for the upcoming sequence of data releases in order to gain more certainty about how the economy is likely to evolve in the coming months. Current Economic Conditions Since I presented a detailed assessment of economic conditions in a speech two weeks ago, today I will mention a few highlights and some new data points. 2 As the flow of official economic reports has been normalizing, my views on the economy have not changed appreciably, in part because I am not taking much signal from the employment and prices data given increased measurement challenges in the wake of the government shutdown. The U.S. economy has been resilient and has continued to expand at a solid pace, but I remain concerned about fragility in the labor market. I am also confident that inflation will come down toward 2 percent as tariff effects on goods inflation continue to wane in coming months. GDP growth strengthened in the third quarter of last year as consumer spending accelerated. However, growth likely slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the government shutdown and softer momentum in consumer spending, consistent with recent weakness in personal income. Disappointingly, residential investment seems on track to decline again in the fourth quarter. Labor Market Conditions Turning to the labor market, we have seen conditions gradually weaken over the past year, as unemployment rose and payroll employment flattened out. Private payroll employment growth slowed further to about 30,000 per month in the fourth quarter, and weekly ADP data show job gains remaining at a similarly subdued pace through early January, well below earlier last year and below the level necessary to keep unemployment stable. Although the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4 percent in December and has moved sideways in recent months, it has increased by 1/4 percentage point since the middle of last year. Moreover, the Conference Board job availability index dropped sharply in January to its lowest value since early 2021, suggesting that the unemployment rate could move back up in the first quarter. The labor market has become increasingly fragile over the past year and could continue to deteriorate in the near term. Despite some tentative signs of the unemployment rate leveling off, it seems too early to say that the labor market has stabilized, especially with the added statistical noise from the government shutdown and the sharp drop in the CPS survey response rate to below the pandemic lows. Job gains have been concentrated in just a few nonbusiness service industries that are less cyclically sensitive, with health care accounting for all private job gains last quarter. With a less dynamic low-hiring, low-firing labor market, which some have said is giving rise to a ""jobless expansion,"" we could see layoffs rise quickly if firms begin to reassess their staffing needs in response to weaker activity. Although initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low, private job cut announcements increased considerably last year, and there has been news of significant additional layoffs in January, as we heard this week from two large employers. Inflation Developments On inflation, we have seen considerable progress in lowering the underlying trend, considering that still-elevated inflation mostly reflects tariff effects on goods prices that I expect will fade this year. After removing these effects, core PCE inflation would have hovered close to 2 percent in recent months. The underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently showing in the data. Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12-month core PCE inflation likely stood at or a little below 3 percent in December, up somewhat since September. However, the Dallas and Cleveland Fed trimmed-mean measures of PCE and CPI price indexes suggest that 12-month core inflation has continued to decline. The discrepancy between these alternative measures of core inflation seems to reflect increased volatility in the recent data, with unusually large price increases in small categories, like software and video streaming, largely explaining the pickup in the core PCE inflation measure since September. Outlook for the Economy Looking ahead, my baseline expectation is that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace and the labor market will stabilize near full employment as monetary policy moves closer to a neutral setting. Less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more favorable business environment will continue to boost supply-largely due to higher productivity-and more than offset any negative effects on economic activity and inflation from other policies. I expect that the supply-side policies that I just mentioned, along with strength in AI-related investment, will continue to boost productivity gains and help ensure that inflation remains on a downward path. The Path Forward On the outlook for monetary policy, with inflation close to 2 percent, after excluding one-off tariff effects, and with unemployment near estimates of its natural rate but at risk of deteriorating, I continue to see policy as moderately restrictive. Downside risks to the labor market have not diminished, and we should not overemphasize the latest reading on the unemployment rate. I appreciated and supported the language in the post-meeting statement about the recent data, which reflects an appropriate characterization of the unemployment data as showing ""some signs of stabilization."" 3 It will take time to get a clear signal about stability in the labor market. My view is that we should continue to focus on downside risks to our employment mandate, and the description of the labor market is helpful to communicate that we are not overly confident. History tells us that the labor market can appear to be stable right up until it isn't. As I think about the upcoming data, I am aware that first-quarter data tend to be more volatile. Therefore, in my view, we should not rely on these data as a reason to delay policy action if we see a sudden and significant deterioration in labor market conditions. We should also not immediately react if we see inflation go up in January, which has been common in recent years and could reflect residual seasonality or additional statistical noise from the government shutdown and ongoing measurement challenges. I recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may be concerned that inflation remains somewhat elevated and that we have not achieved our inflation goal for some time. However, absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should be ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral. We should also not imply that we expect to maintain the current stance of policy for an extended period of time because it would signal that we are not attentive to the risk that labor market conditions could deteriorate. At the same time, it is important to remember that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will evaluate incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to our dual-mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to inform my assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of policy. Closing Thoughts As the economy continues to evolve, policy must evolve with it. My focus will remain on acting early enough to preserve both price stability and a strong labor market. Thank you again for the invitation to share my views with you today. It is a pleasure to join you. 1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 See Michelle W.

In its report, Moody's stated that Indonesia's rating is affirmed at Baa2 reflecting its strong economic resilience, reflected in stable and solid economic growth, and supported by structural strengths such as natural resources endowments and favorable demographics, which support the medium-term growth outlook. Indonesia's rating affirmation is also supported by the credibility of monetary policy and fiscal prudence, which supports macroeconomic and financial system stability. Meanwhile, the revised outlook is influenced by Moody's view of the risk of a decline in policy predictability, which if continued could have implications for economic performance. Moody's affirmed the Sovereign Credit Rating of the Republic of Indonesia at Baa2 and revised the outlook to negative, as announced on 5 February 2026. Responding to Moody's decision, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo stated, “The outlook adjustment does not reflect any weakening in Indonesia's economic fundamentals. Despite elevated global uncertainty, the domestic economy remains resilient. Economic growth reached 5.39% in the fourth quarter of 2025, bringing full-year growth to 5.1%. Inflation was maintained at 2.92% in 2025, within the target range, while Rupiah exchange rate stability continues to be strengthened through Bank Indonesia's strong policy commitment. Financial system stability also remains well preserved, supported by ample liquidity, strong bank capital, and low credit risk. Moreover, the continued expansion of digital payment systems—underpinned by reliable infrastructure and a sound industry structure—has further reinforced stability and supported economic growth."" Moody's projects that Indonesia's economic growth will remain in the range of 5% in the short to medium term, with economic resilience maintained. Moody's assesses that the fiscal deficit is expected to remain below 3% of GDP, while monetary policy is seen to continue to support inflation stability. Moody's also predicts that the government's debt-to-GDP ratio will remain low below peers. Nevertheless, according to Moody's, Indonesia still faces the challenge of increasing its revenue base, which is needed to drive economic growth while maintaining macro and financial stability. In this regard, Moody's appreciates the Government's efforts to boost revenue, among others, through improving the efficiency of tax and customs administration. Going forward, Bank Indonesia forecasts that Indonesia's economic growth prospects in the medium term will remain solid with an upward trend, supported by maintained inflation. Economic growth in 2026 is projected to increase within the range of 4.9–5.7%, underpinned by stronger domestic demand in line with various Government policies and the continued positive impact of Bank Indonesia's policy mix. This positive performance is predicted to continue to increase in 2027, with projected economic growth in the range of 5.1-5.9%, as well as inflation that will remain maintained. The external resilience of the Indonesian economy also remains strong amid global uncertainty. Indonesia's Balance of Payments (BOP) was maintained solid, driven by a positive trade balance. The trade balance in December 2025 recorded a surplus of 2.51 billion US dollars, supported by non-oil and gas exports based on natural resources and manufacturing. Indonesia's foreign exchange reserve position at the end of December 2025 increased to 156.5 billion US dollars, equivalent to financing 6.4 months of imports or 6.3 months of imports and repayment of the Government's external debt, and above the international adequacy standard of around 3 months of imports. The BOP in 2026 is expected to remain solid with the current account deficit remaining low in the range of deficits 0.9-0.1% of GDP. The rupiah exchange rate is projected to remain stable with a strengthening trend, supported by attractive yields, low inflation, and Indonesia's solid economic growth prospects, as well as Bank Indonesia's commitment to maintaining rupiah stability. Financial system stability is also maintained, supported by ample bank liquidity, high capital, and low credit risk. Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen its policy mix to maintain macroeconomic and financial system stability while promoting sustainable economic growth amid heightened global uncertainty. These efforts will be carried out in close synergy with the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) and in support of the Government's Asta Cita Program and continue to coordinate with the Government to strengthen policy communication to maintain market confidence.

I am delighted to be here for the first time. It is a privilege to join you today. We meet at a moment of profound global transformation. Geopolitical tensions are rising, trade and financial flows are being re-wired, supply chains reconfigured, and energy systems reimagined. All this when technology is advancing at remarkable speed, in particular the role of AI. So, it is no surprise that uncertainty remains elevated and is likely to be the new normal. It is precisely at such moments that cooperation is needed the most. And this is what I’d like to speak to you about today. North Africa has a significant opportunity—an opportunity to deepen its cooperation, trade and integration with sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, and to offer greater growth and prosperity for its people. Of course, the region already has a history of such economic links with trade routes and investment flows with Europe—and more recently, greater engagement with its southern neighbors. The signing of Africa’s continental free trade agreement is just such an example. It holds the promise of becoming one of the drivers of integration across the continent, with benefits not only for its own people but also for Europe. My message to you is this: supercharge this integration. Today, Europe is looking to expand its trade partnerships. Sub-Saharan Africa is looking for avenues to tap the potential of its vast resources and people. And North Africa offers numerous opportunities for investment and partnership. Think of manufacturing hubs that source raw materials or intermediate goods from sub-Saharan Africa. Or, joint infrastructure projects—such as cross-regional railways or digital connectivity platforms. These could unlock economies of scale and improve logistical efficiency across the continent. Energy is another powerful example. With abundant solar and wind resources, North Africa can power industries at home and abroad—supporting Europe’s energy transition, alleviating Africa’s electricity gaps, and accelerating technology transfer across regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa still today 600 million people lack access to electricity—something that the rest of us simply cannot imagine living without. Algeria, in fact, is showing the way with its dual energy advantage—by advancing hybrid solar‑gas projects in the Sahara, expanding power interconnections with Europe, and investing in green hydrogen for export. So, how should policymakers supercharge this integration? First, reduce barriers to trade. Average North African import tariffs standing at 7 percent are higher than those in many ASEAN, GCC, EU and sub-Saharan Africa economies. While Europe accounts for most of North Africa’s trade, trade between North and sub-Saharan Africa is negligible, representing only 4 percent of exports and just 1 percent of imports. We can do more. Second, implement reforms that strengthen the trade and business environment. Efficient trade logistics, a predictable business and regulatory environment, strong governance—these are all essential for investment and exports. For example, modernizing ports and customs systems, and investing in cross-border corridors like the Trans-Maghreb and Cairo–Dakar highways—can dramatically improve connectivity and competitiveness. For new engines of growth to flourish, the region must become a hub where goods, services and capital flow more freely and businesses thrive. Finally, focus on people, the backbone of any economy. North Africa already possesses strong human capital, but there is an opportunity to take that to the next level. Investments in technical and vocational education, enhancing workforce skills including in AI, investments in health – these can all support inclusive, productivity-driven growth. The potential benefits of these reforms are significant. In a new IMF report we published today, we show that a comprehensive package of reforms that increase North Africa’s economic linkages with Europe and sub-Saharan Africa could boost the level of North Africa’s exports by 16 percent and GDP by over 7 percent—increasing economic output by 67 billion dollars. There would also be meaningful benefits for both sub-Saharan Africa and Europe through greater supply-chain participation and investment, and greater resilience and growth in neighboring regions. Let me conclude. When I was preparing for this conference, I learned this Arabic saying: “El yed el wahda ma tsaffeq”—which translates as one hand does not clap. It is a fitting metaphor for our task. Because in times of sweeping transformations, cooperation is not optional, it is essential. That is why I am so pleased to see participants from across North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Europe here today to discuss ways to supercharge their integration and collaboration. From Algiers to Alexandria and Lagos to Lisbon. Working together, we can bring prosperity and opportunity to millions of people. Thank you.",html,2026-02-06 02:49:32,FALSE,False,Skipped (Keyword),False,Skipped (Keyword)

The authorities have consented to the publication of the Staff Report prepared for this consultation.","February 6, 2026 Washington, DC: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas[1] and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting, on a lapse-of-time basis. The authorities have consented to the publication of the Staff Report prepared for this consultation.[2] The Bahamian economy has strengthened in recent years, with real GDP expanding by 3.4 percent in 2024. Growth remained resilient in the first half of 2025, supported by construction and cruise tourism, and the unemployment rate stood at 9.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025. Inflation has decelerated (1.3 percent in July 2025), partly reflecting lower global energy prices. The fiscal position continued to improve in the last fiscal year. Driven by tax revenues and expenditure containment, the primary balance remained in surplus and the fiscal deficit narrowed to 0.5 percent of GDP in FY2024/25. Central government debt has declined but is still elevated, at around 74 percent of GDP. Growth is expected to be around 2.8 percent in 2025, and then it would gradually slow toward 1½ percent (the assessed potential growth rate of the economy). Headline inflation is projected to settle at around 2 percent, and the current account deficit would narrow to about 6 percent of GDP over the medium term. Risks to the outlook are balanced, with downside risks including a potential global slowdown with adverse impact on tourism, and natural disasters. Upside risks notably include greater-than-expected effects of public and private infrastructure projects linked to tourism and the energy sector reform. Executive Board Assessment[3] In concluding the 2025 Article IV consultation with The Bahamas, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows: “The economy has strengthened in recent years. Robust post-pandemic tourism has been a key driver of economic growth and fiscal revenues. Actions have been taken to improve public finances and to enhance disaster risk management. Continued fiscal consolidation, the ongoing electricity sector reform, increased capacity for tourism, and investment in climate resilience will be critical to further reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and foster sustained growth. “Growth is expected to moderate gradually. Growth in 2025 has been supported by construction and cruise tourism, but the economic expansion is expected to slow somewhat in 2026, converging toward the estimated potential rate of 1½ percent over the medium term. Risks are broadly balanced, with downside risks including a potential global slowdown and natural disasters, and upside risks entailing greater-than-expected effects of public and private infrastructure projects linked to tourism and the electricity reform. Inflation remains low. “Additional policy measures are necessary to achieve the authorities’ medium-term target for central government debt. A primary surplus was reached again in FY2024/25, and the FY2025/26 budget targets an overall surplus. While declining, public debt remains elevated. Going forward, new revenue-enhancing and expenditure-optimizing measures should be prioritized to achieve the authorities’ 50 percent of GDP target for central government debt. These measures can include introducing corporate and personal income taxes, rationalizing tax expenditures, raising the standard VAT rate, and reducing transfers to SOEs. These efforts can give space to invest more in priority areas, such as education and resilient infrastructure. “More work is needed to strengthen fiscal institutions and reduce fiscal risks. An immediate priority should be to improve fiscal reporting and enhance the institutional framework for PPPs. It is also critical to accurately assess and mitigate fiscal risks arising from SOEs. The planned reform to civil service pensions should be supplemented with more holistic changes to address actuarial imbalances. Advancing plans to adopt an accrual-based accounting system for the budget would improve fiscal transparency. Efforts to reduce debt rollover risks should continue. “Financial sector policies should continue to aim at preserving financial stability. Systemic financial stability risks remain moderate. As bank credit to the private sector increases, safeguarding banks’ resilience is crucial, including by monitoring potential risks stemming from banks’ exposure to the sovereign. The oversight of nonbanks should be strengthened, and closing data gaps is a priority. Operationalizing real estate price indices is still needed. Planned legal reforms can help improve resolution frameworks and safety nets. Reducing the ceiling on central bank advances to the government would support the exchange rate peg, and it is essential to maintain efforts to implement the 2024 DARE Act. Actions to enhance risk-based AML/CFT supervision and promote financial inclusion should continue. “Fostering economic resilience and investing in human and physical capital should ease supply-side constraints to growth. Policies to raise productivity, together with fiscal consolidation, can help narrow external imbalances, given that the external position is moderately weaker than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Ongoing infrastructure projects in hotels and airports can alleviate capacity constraints in tourism. To reduce vulnerable employment and lessen informality, it is important to cut red tape for businesses, strengthen education, and continue expanding training and upskilling opportunities. Trade diversification could strengthen economic resilience and reduce import costs (with more benefits for consumers if coupled with greater product market competition). The energy sector reform is advancing and may significantly improve the cost and reliability of electricity. There is scope to continue enhancing disaster risk management and investing in climate resilience.

A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. [2] Under the IMF's Articles of Agreement, publication of documents that pertain to member countries is voluntary and requires the member consent. The staff report will be shortly published on the www.imf.org/Bahamas page.

Missions are undertaken as part of regular (usually annual) consultations under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, in the context of a request to use IMF resources (borrow from the IMF), as part of discussions of staff monitored programs, or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments. Jerusalem, Israel: Israel’s economy has demonstrated notable resilience. Following the Gaza ceasefire, economic activity accelerated markedly, and staff expect growth to firm in the near term. But there are downside risks, including from potential renewed regional tensions. The conflict’s legacy is substantial: defense spending remains elevated, risk premia are higher, and labor supply is constrained by extended military mobilization and reduced availability of non-Israeli workers. These pressures would compound longstanding structural challenges—such as persistently low labor market participation among specific groups—and weigh on the medium-term economic outlook. Economic outlook and risks Restoring fiscal buffers amid higher defense spending Advancing the longstanding structural reform agenda Ensuring price and financial stability, and strengthening financial integrity The mission thanks the authorities and private sector counterparts for their warm hospitality and candid and high-quality discussions. The IMF team is especially grateful to the Bank of Israel for its assistance with meeting and logistical arrangements.

The regulator summed up the results of the first MPR in 2023. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of monetary policy taking into account the evolution of macroeconomic conditions. The Bank of Russia plans to carry out analytical work and public discussions in 2026–2027 and summarise MPR findings by mid-2028. The analysis will comprise six work streams, specifically ‘Inflation target format’, ‘Operational framework of monetary policy’, ‘Retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of monetary policy’, ‘Communication as a monetary policy instrument’, ‘Interaction of monetary policy and other economic policies’, and ‘Long-term trends and monetary policy’. The Bank of Russia encourages leading experts, researchers, and analysts to join the analysis of monetary policy within these work streams. In the middle of 2027, the regulator plans a scientific conference to discuss the results of studies conducted by both Bank of Russia specialists and external experts. In the course of MPR 2028, the Bank of Russia will carry out meetings with representatives of businesses, public organisations, government authorities and the academic and expert community, professional financial market participants, and citizens.
